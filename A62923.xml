            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT hath been the Wiſdom of the moſt Couragious, Powerful, and Happy Kings, to make uſe of Oracles and Prophecies, to the advancement of their moſt glorious Deſigns. Theſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afforded them good Directions, and always gave their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers conſiderable Encouragements. The Examples of all Hiſtories, Sacred and Prophane, and of our Adverſaries, commend this Practice to our Imitation, wherein we are incouraged by many great Advantages which we have over them. The ſacred Oracles are all for us, that our Divines have demonſtrated beyond all Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Eſdras,</hi> whom ſome have recommended as Canonical; <hi>Savana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rola,</hi> whom our Authors extol to the degree of Martyrdom, and the <hi>Roman</hi> wiſe Hiſtorian and learned Philoſophers, advance to the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of a Saint and Prophet; <hi>Tycho Brahe, Grebner, Baudenſis,</hi> and other reputed Aſtrologers, with whom our Modern Foreign, as well as Domeſtick Viſions and Prophecies conſent, do all with one Voice promiſe admirable Succeſs to that Northern Prince who Heads the Proteſtant League, and Protects their Liberties. That Star from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiopaea's</hi> glorious Chair, which gave light to all the World, <hi>A. C.</hi> 1572, to obſerve the then new-born Engliſh Reformation; thoſe from the Swans Neck and <hi>Serpentarius</hi> Foot, which illuſtrated the Acceſs of your Royal Grand-Father to the Britiſh Monarchy, whereof that in <hi>Cygnus, An.</hi> 1600, uſhered it, and that in <hi>Ophiuchus, An.</hi> 1604, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; All three together give full and undeniable Teſtimony that this Honour is reſerved to your Crown and Family. And that moſt reful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent appearance of the moſt ſerene and beauteous Light of Heaven which exhilerated your Subjects at your happy Birth, as it poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out your Perſon to them, ſo it gave utterance to their Joys in hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Predictions, made all your People Prophets, and turned their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into Bleſſings and Prophecies. Nor may your Imperial Name, your Royal Emblems, Impreſa's, Mottoes, or Coyns, be here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, wherein whilſt you own Chriſt for your Guide and Hope, and his Croſs for your Standard, your Kingdom muſt needs be the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and his Chriſt. Your <hi>George</hi> is St. <hi>Michael,</hi> as your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel-Gold
<pb facs="tcp:99590:3"/>well interprets it; and the Dragon, whom he combats and treads under his Horſe's Feet, is the Head of that Kingdom, which oppoſes Yours, and ſeeks by the Serpentine ſnares of his Tail, more than the open force of his Teeth, to overthrow your Horſe and his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. It is the Finger of God, which in that wonderful Agate, which I have deſcribed at the foot of this Book, hath diſtinguiſhed his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Princes of our Faith, from the Papacy, and the reſt of the World; and thereby taught us to know who are with him, and who againſt him. Had you no other juſt Call, or cauſe to gird on your Sword, and go out as another <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Captain of the Lord's Hoſts, againſt his Enemies, the publick Voice of your People, who are the People of God, ſounding ſo long and loud in your Ears, the Cries and Groans of the Oppreſſed through all <hi>Europe,</hi> applying and appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your Throne, as under God, the only hopeful Protector of their Crowns, Dignities, Lives and Liberties, bring you an undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Commiſſion, if I may not ſay a Command from Heaven. Here, if ever, <hi>vox Populi,</hi> is <hi>vox Dei.</hi> The Voice of many Nations, compared to the Roaring of many Waters, is the Voice of God, God in them; the Voice of Chriſtendom is the Voice of Chriſt, Chriſt in them. Go on then, for He who went out before <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his, and their Captain-General, is gone out before You, as before him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your People and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>They who have begun to ſhake and fall, ſhall fall, and be removed before Yours and your Succeſſors, as they have fallen before the Swords of your Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>That I have to this purpoſe at large in this Book, endeavoured to proclaim your Title, plead your Cauſe; gird on your Arms, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage your Souldiers and Confederate's Hearts, open your Subjects Purſes, in ſo ſacred an Expedition from Prophetick Stars, Prodigies, and no leſs than prodigious Dreams and Viſions. As I am aſſured, it cannot but be grateful to all your Loyal People, who would moſt gladly enlarge your Kingdom at the expence of their Blood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; prolong your Life, if it were poſſible, with a prodigal Effuſion of their own, and give their whole Stock thereof, reſerving no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto themſelves, to perpetuate your Reign, in the Breath of whoſe Noſtrils they draw what Life they now retain of Peace, Joy, Trade, Liberty of Conſcience above all Nations round about them: So, I hope, this ſmall Contribution, collected out of my ſlender Stock, will not be unacceptable, thus ſeaſonably preſented to your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Hands,</p>

            <head>An Admonition to the Reader, concerning the Title of the Fourth Monarchy given to this Book, rather than that of the Fifth Monarchy, ſo much doted on by ſome of our Days.</head>
            <p>HIſtorians have made their Four Monarchies according to the Riſe and Fall of the Empires of ſeveral particular Nations. 1. <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> 2. <hi>Perſians.</hi> 3. <hi>Grecians.</hi> 4. <hi>Romans.</hi> But this is a lame Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and comes far ſhort of that Tranſcendent Metamorphoſis of Humane Affairs, which by comparing of Hiſtories, Obſervation of new Stars and Comets (with the conſideration of the Manners and Conditions of Men) we may eaſily perceive muſt within this few Years (from 1650, ſaith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) be brought upon the World. The learned Mathematicians and Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (who have more throughly ſearched into the ſecrets of <hi>Aſtrology</hi> and Nature) more rightly place the Four Monarchies according to the four Coaſts of Heaven. 1. The Eaſtern Monarchy of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> (ſome reckon the <hi>Perſians</hi> into this.) 2. Southern of the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> bounded within the Circumference of 3600 miles, or 11 degrees of Latitude. 3. The Weſtern Monarchy of the <hi>Romans.</hi> 4. And laſtly, The Northern Monarchy (by the Hiſtorical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the Fifth) muſt be of the Northern Lion, who to the amazement of Chriſtendom, ſhall ariſe from the North Sea, and pitch his Tents in the aſhes of the Eaſtern and Weſtern Monarchies. <hi>Anonymus Future Hiſtory of Europe,</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.

               <p>THe Fourth Monarchy, ſo numbred by the Learned Philoſophers, which ſome, with the Hiſtorians, do rather delight to call the Fifth, gives all Men an hopeful Expectation that it will Tranſcend all that are gone before in excellent Purity of Religion, and Perfection of happy Government. Some Divines have been bold to entitle the Northern Kings of <hi>England, Scotland, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> to it, by applying unto them what is ſpoken of the Chariots of the Black Horſes in <hi>Zachariah</hi> vi. 8. and to the Reformation begun by them. Theſe are ſaid by the Prophet, to have gone out of the Brazen Mountains into the North, and to have pacified God's Spirit, and ſettled his Temple in the North Country.</p>
               <p>See <hi>Michael Rotingius</hi> in the Margent, concerning the Reformation, of which this is the Tranſlation.</p>
            </div>

               <head>Michael Rotingius <hi>on</hi> Zach. vi. 8.</head>
               <p>THe Prophet <hi>Zacariah,</hi> beſides other things, relates alſo what he ſaw con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Four Chariots, what came forth from amongſt the Brazen Mountains. Theſe Horſes then go out into the whole World, that they may build a Temple for our Lord Chriſt, and that He may ſit Lord
<pb facs="tcp:99590:5"/>and Chriſt upon his own Throne.—Now this is executed moſt ſwiftly, as it were by the miniſtry of Horſes. But to what Point this whole Affair will at length ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, the Angel gives us to underſtand, when, ſpeaking of the Black Horſes which go into the North, he thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds himſelf, Theſe ſhall make the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord to reſt in the Land of the North. By which words, the laſt Times of the Church, without doubt, are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Wee ſee the North moſt eſpecially deſigned for the Seat of the Lord's Spirit by the Angel in the Prophet.</p>
               <p>Let any Man (ſaith he) draw an Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of this from the beginning made at this time; the Popiſh Abominations are in very many places renounced, many have confuted their Impiety with the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their Blood; the People aſſemble in Towns and Villages with true Paſtors; they attend to the glad Tidings of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; Schools are piouſly inſtituted, where beſides other good Arts, and Learning, neceſſary to inſtruct Youth in making a ſound judgment of Affairs, the Doctrine of Piety is moſt exactly taught them, whereby they become at once very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and very Serviceable; Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Families are better and more orderly governed and taught, than the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Colledges were ſometimes in the Univerſities. So great is our Felicity, that the Infant and Sucking-Child, deſpiſes the Cockatrice and Addar.</p>
               <p>Thus he of the Firſt-fruits of the Reformation, by which we may, as he teaches us, collect, what the Harveſt under the Fourth Monarchy may produce.</p>

               <p>I muſt not preſume here to the Honour of a Doctor of the Church, or an Interpreter of the Divine Oracles. I deal indeed with Prophets, Seers, Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Revelations, but of an inferiour Claſs, ſuch as aſpire not to any Place in the Sacred Canon. <hi>Eſdras</hi> himſelf, who hath had that Reputation with ſome, is left out by the Decree of the late Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and not without juſt Cauſe; for all the latter Prophecies, which have made the World ring with their Noiſe againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> are but the Ecchoes of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and only give us in his words, often repeated, the Fall of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; as this Book will ſhew at large. And I aſſure my ſelf, that whoſoever hath any Veneration for <hi>Eſdras,</hi> cannot lightly deſpiſe the other, who are manifeſtly inſpired with the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The <hi>Sibylline</hi> Prophecies may ſeem to be of the ſame Extract; as they are allowed to be of like Antiquity with <hi>Eſdras,</hi> but they are neither ſo Expreſs, nor particular in their Predictions. Of what Spirit ſoever theſe Modern Prophecies were, they are ſo conſiderable, that he who by his Arms is reputed an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance to <hi>Europe,</hi> thinks no ſcorn to ſeek in the Aſhes of one of them ſome Encouragement to his Pretenſions. I hope then none will be offended, if I put theſe Paper-Bullets in my Countrymens Mouths, for their better Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and Defence, whilſt they are Arming themſelves, and marching out
<pb facs="tcp:99590:5"/>in a Conjuncture more probable to fulfil what yet remains for them to do, than any of their Adverſaries yet had, who have by force ſought to corrupt and draw thoſe Viſions to their ſide. <hi>Poſtellus</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> and others on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſide, have long ſince muſtered their Prophecies and Arguments, whilſt their Maſters on each part were armed with vain hopes to prevail by them, and fulfil them. I begin with <hi>Eſdras</hi> as the moſt Ancient, moſt Reputed, and from whom it is not hard for any Humane Spirit, that had been well acquainted with his Text, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered his words, to propheſy what our Modern Pretenders have ſet out with various Amplifications, as the Spirit that conducted them, did prompt or ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt. And becauſe our <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who look ſo big, and with ſuch ſtrange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, againſt all Natural and Moral Reaſons, as well as all Prophetical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations and Revelations, think to drown all their Enemies in a deluge of Blood, and to poſſeſs a deſolated World alone, are principally concerned; I will give them <hi>Eſdras,</hi> in their own <hi>Doway</hi> Tranſlation, and then ſet down the leſſer and more Modern Prophecies in the convenienteſt order I can contrive them, the better to ſhew their conſent with him, and one another.</p>

            <p>ASſure thy ſelf what ever Spirit dictated theſe Predictions, whether they be Crumbs fallen to Dogs, or Fragments of the Prophetick Bread bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Spirit of Chriſt in the Scriptures, and therefore preſerved by Diſciples as well as they could in theſe homely Baskets, or not, that which they foretel will certainly (in God's time) by his Hand be effected, by ſuch Perſons, and in ſuch times as he pleaſes, in whoſe Power, Inſtruments, Times and Seaſons are reſerved: And therefore the Kingdom ſhall certainly be reſtored to his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that in the time of theſe Kings, who gave their Power to the Whore; but they then ſhall become Nurſing Fathers to his People, hate her, and burn her Fleſh with Fire. They, who have ſeen the yet ſmoaking Ruines of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> are witneſſes for <hi>Auſtria, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> of what iſſue theſe Wars will have, and what the Fomentors of them may expect at laſt.</p>
            <p>The intent of the worthy Authors and former Publiſhers of theſe Prophecies, was to reprove and admoniſh the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and Empire, becauſe of their cruel Perſecutions, and to comfort and encourage the Suffering Church and People under their Afflictions, by a proſpect of God's Juſtice on their Enemies certainly Predicted and partly Executed, as an earneſt of their Deliverance and Teſtimony to the truth of theſe Prophecies. This is a Mite caſt into the ſame Treaſury, and may ſerve to whet the Courages of their Armed, and ſteell the Patience of their Suffering Friends. What was ſaid of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Valour, is much more true of the Chriſtian Patience, <hi>Saepe pugna nunquam bello victi:</hi> Though the Valiant Men on both ſides, like thoſe twelve that played before <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Abner,</hi> fall equally; <hi>David</hi>'s Kingdom, the Kingdom of God's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, ſhall grow ſtronger, and <hi>Saul</hi>'s, the Kingdom of Hell, weaker. And if any think the Subject too light, I muſt be content to ſuffer with <hi>Picus, Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Bibliander,</hi> if their Quotations out of Primitive Fathers help them not, as well as me, which may be produced hereafter, if this Eſſay meet not with too much Diſcouragement.</p>
            <p>Theſe Prophecies were Collected in ſeaſon, when it was expected, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Intereſt, we might have headed the Proteſtant Party with the then new raiſed Forces, and therewith have covered the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire it ſelf, now manifeſtly going to Ruine and falling to Powder, betwixt the mighty Bodies that preſs upon it on both ſides, as well as by its own internal Diviſions in its Iron and Clay Supporters. They were firſt thrown together as it were in Jeſt, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe Prophecies wherewith the <hi>French</hi> vainly did tickle and ſwell their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition with the vaſt expectations of an unjuſt, uſurped, abſolute Tyranny over the free People of <hi>Europe,</hi> in which they have miſtaken groſly the Nature of the Monarchy they affect, as well as the Body which muſt be headed by it. Had the Collector been ſerious, he could have confuted them by unanſwerable Arguments
<pb facs="tcp:99590:6"/>out of holy Writ, and ſhewed them that the Fourth Monarchy is the Kingdom of Chriſt, whoſe Commiſſion from his Father is not for his own, who needs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but for the Publick Good and Intereſt of the Chriſtian World; his Bliſs being to do them good, and his Glory to encreaſe the number of his Subjects, and their Peace, Wealth, and Godlineſs. It might have been ſhown, that tho the Weſtern great Toe, <hi>France,</hi> now (and <hi>Spain</hi> heretofore) may be formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſwoln in its proportions in the <hi>Popiſh,</hi> as the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> in the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, yet neither the one nor the other ſhall ever come into one Stump Foot, but contrariwiſe, if <hi>Daniel</hi> or <hi>Ezra</hi> be a Prophet, moult away, break, or be broken to pieces, be ground to Powder, and ſcattered by the Wind over the Face of the whole Earth. But we need not heave ſo weighty a Maul to kill a Flie, nor are theſe Prophecies upon ſecond view found ſo light; but that they will much overpoiſe what hath or can be ſaid on the other ſide, nor perhaps are they now altogether unſeaſonable, conſidering with what Impudence their falſe Prophets have lately given out their Helliſh Oracles againſt his Majeſties Life: And with what horrid Malice they ſeek to engage and provoke their wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to fulfil them.</p>
            <p>This was written, as appears by the Date of the Epiſtle, in the Author's <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript,</hi> yet extent, about the time of their execrable Conſult at <hi>Wild Houſe</hi> (their Mock-Parliament) againſt his Majeſties Life; who knows but it may now, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, ſerve to repel the Spirits of ſome of their audacious Inſtruments, that they may not grow too Wiſe and Confident in their own Folly. I hope, I may be allowed to anſwer ſomething to them according thereto. Firſt, To their Aſtrologer, <hi>Briggs</hi> the great Mathematician long ago aſſured us, That the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert and learned Aſtrologer, would be able out of any Schemes, to draw Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo contradictory upon well ballanced Teſtimonies, that the common Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers Oracles muſt be as uncertain from his Art as the <hi>Delphick</hi> themſelves; Nor can any Man doubt of the uncertainty of Aſtrologers Predictions, who ſhall take the pains to compare the different Calculations of our famed Aſtrologers; for inſtance, of <hi>Gadbury</hi> and <hi>Partridge,</hi> in that which they call the Vernal Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure this Year, or Tranſit of ☉ into ♈. To <hi>Gadbury</hi> it is at two of the Clock and 50 minutes after Noon, and to <hi>Partridge</hi> at 5 of the Clock and 14 minutes. <hi>Gad.</hi> hath the 27th of ♌ on the Cuſp of the firſt Houſe, and <hi>Part.</hi> hath ♏ 22. The tenth Houſe, or Mid-Heaven, as they call it, is with <hi>Gad.</hi> ♉ 15, with <hi>Part.</hi> ♊ 10; yet hence they each of them Predict as confidently the Fates of King, Kingdom, and People, as if they were agreed of the ſame moment of time and minute of the Aſcendents degree. ♄ is with <hi>Gad.</hi> in the 11th Houſe, with <hi>Part.</hi> in the middle of the 10th, intercepted in ♋, as they call it. ♃ with <hi>Gad.</hi> within one degree of the very cuſp of the 9th, with <hi>Part.</hi> within 4 of the cuſp of the 10th. ♂ and ☉ to <hi>Gad.</hi> in the 8th, to <hi>Part.</hi> in the 7th. And which is much worſe, <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> in the 18th, ♏ in the 14th Houſe with <hi>Gad.</hi> and in the o. 29. of ♐ in the 3d, to <hi>Part.</hi> If theſe Men from ſo different Calculations both write true, then Aſtrology muſt needs be as Infallible as his Holineſs, who never errs be the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes by which he judges never ſo falſe, as of late when he condemn'd the Articles in <hi>Janſenius</hi> of Hereſy, that neither he nor any Man elſe could ever find in his Books. But let us examine our Catholick Almanack, and Presbyterian-Plot-maker, <hi>Leo, cor Leonis,</hi> &amp;c. aſcends the Horoſcope, there he concludes the People of <hi>England</hi> high Elevated, Aſpiring, Ambitious, Torrent like, Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting, Subtle to compaſs unreaſonable ends, a Spirit of Pride let looſe amongſt us, and of Fraud, Hypocriſy, to Entrap, Enſnare, betray Friends, our own party of the ſame Feather; Thence he threatens the briskeſt of the Contriving Tribe, that is in plain terms, he threatens and would Intimidate the King's and Kingdoms Evidence, and their Patrons, and all good Patriots, and particularly him who hath ♌ for his Horoſcope, ♄ for his Enemy; by which, if he mean ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titous
<pb facs="tcp:99590:7"/>Friars, Monks, and Jeſuits, he needed not have lifted his Head ſo high as Heaven to tell us, That his Converſe with them on Earth aſſured him better, and it is manifeſt what his Book drives at. But <hi>Partridge,</hi> who had no ſuch deſign to Intimidate or Abuſe the Commons of <hi>England</hi> from their juſt Reſentment and Proſecution of the Bloody Traytors, and theirs and their Soveraign's implacable Enemies, nor to encourage or harden them to their intended Aſſaſſinations as <hi>G.</hi> had, finds no ſuch Pride or Unreaſonableneſs in them by his Scheme. Nor could he ſo eaſily ſmell the Treachery of the Birds of the ſame Feather by the Stars, as <hi>Gadbury</hi> by the help of his fellow Presbyterian-Plot-makers, of whoſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery to the Birds whoſe Feathers they pretended to be of his Eyes and Ears, were daily more faithful Witneſſes than any Stars. But in the interim, his good hopes and affections to thoſe of his own Feather, ſuffered him not to ſuſpect that his contriving Tribe would be found out by Providence, and afterwards betrayed by their own [Black-Birds] nor could he find it in the Heavens.

               </q> Is verified of him, as of his Maſter the Author of the old <hi>Delphick Oracle,</hi> no great honour to the Art certainly; but I never underſtood ſo well that Rule given to the Novices of this Art, <hi>A te &amp; à Scientia.</hi> What an Artiſt knows, or hath contrived he may boldly predict, and where Science cannot advance by lawful means a wicked Action, if bad Conſcience ſtep in, the credit of the Art may ſo be ſaved for a while, but the Artiſt deſerves to periſh for the help he hath brought to his goodly Art, by his ungodly Conſcience. But to return to our Horoſcope and ♌ there, and our Friend thence threatned by <hi>Gadbury,</hi> who as well as his Maſter might have been eaſily Aſſaſſinated, had <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s Art or Honeſty been worth Credit. That which pleaſes and ſatisfies me beſt, is to find in another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that his Friend <hi>Partridge</hi> derives comfort to the ſame Gentleman (if I be a good Gueſſer) from this, that his Horo ſcope is in ♌ and not very far from <hi>Cor Leonis,</hi> with which this Vernal Ingreſs is adorned by <hi>Gadbury.</hi> A Cordial reviving his ſpent Spirits, with news of Reconciliation, and laying aſide all Animoſities by an amicable Ray from the Royal <hi>Sol</hi> in favourable aſpect with ♂, darted unto ſtationary <hi>Jove</hi> in ♊. I ſee where the one ſeeks Corroſives, the other finds Cordials. If I ſhould enter into further odious Compariſons of this kind, I ſhould be infinite: Whilſt I write this, a learned Friend tells me, That the Caroline Tables are much better than thoſe which were in common uſe before: This helps to ſcandalize me farther againſt Aſtrology, for it will never go down with me if the difference be ſuch as I find here, that the Rules made for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer can be true of the latter; for certainly what ever was Calculated and Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before theſe new Tables were made, would have had another different ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, had it been judged by the Calculation of theſe; and how both Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be Verified and ſignifie the ſame thing, I cannot comprehend. Nor believe I, that any Learned Aſtrologer will undertake to verefie any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments paſſed by the old Rules on Calculations by the old Tables upon Schems, erected for the ſame Ingreſſes of any Cardinal Points by the new. I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have done, but a new ſcruple riſes in my Mind, that all Aſpects as Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (and Tranſits too) are ſo diverſified by the differences of theſe Tables, that I ſee not that the common Aſtrologer will be able to underſtand applications to favourable Aſpects, from the ſeparations ſo readily and certainly as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of ſuch Caſes and Significations require he ſhould; ſo that I may as well go to the <hi>Shepherds Kalendar</hi> and throw Dice there to know my Fortune, as to a meer Artiſt in <hi>Aſtrology;</hi> becauſe the firſt Maſters and Founders of <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> had never any true Calculations, and conſequently never any ſubſtrate cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Matter, whereon to found an Art or Science by Obſervation, and it's a

And I could give Inſtances of learned and ſerious Men, who ſolicitous for their own Reputation, and that of the Art, were inſpired with Anſwers as far above Nature, as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to, or beſides their Scheam; and one for inſtance did direct his Querent to find his Silver Cup (where he never would have looked for it) in the head of his Neighbours Wooden Pump: Another by Geomanoy, could not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="2">2. And I ſaw, and behold, ſhe ſpread her Wings into all the Earth, and all the Winds of Heaven blew upon her, and were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And I ſaw, of her Feathers ſprang contrary Feathers, and they became little Wings and ſmall.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For her Heads were at reſt, and the middle Head was greater than the other Heads; but ſhe reſted with them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And I ſaw, and beheld the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle flew with her Wings, and reigned over the Earth, and over them that dwelt in it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And I ſaw, that all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven were ſubject to her, and no Man gain-ſaid her, no not one of the Creatures that is upon the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And I ſaw, and behold, the Eagle roſe up upon her Tallous, and made a voice with her Wings, ſaying,</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Watch not altogether, ſleep every one in his place; and watch according to time;</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But let the Heads be preſerved to the laſt.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And I ſaw, and behold, the Voice came not out of her Heads, but from the midſt of her Body.</p>

                  <p n="12">12. And I ſaw, and beheld on the right ſide roſe one Wing, and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over all the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And it came to paſs, when it reigned, an end came to it, and the place thereof appeared not; and the next roſe up and reigned, that held much time.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And it came to paſs when it reigned, and the end of it alſo came that it appeared not as the former.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And, behold, a Voice was ſent forth to it, ſaying.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Hear thou that haſt held the Earth off a long time; Thus I tell thee, before thou begin not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>

                  <p n="19">19. And ſo it chanced to all the other by one and by one to have the Principality, and again to appear no where.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And I ſaw, and beheld, in time the reſt of the Wings were ſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right ſide, that they alſo might hold the Principality, and of them there were that held it; but yet forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they appeared not.</p>

                  <p n="22">22. And I ſaw, after theſe things, and behold the twelve Wings, and the two little Wings appeared not.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And nothing remained in the body of the Eagle, but two Heads reſting, and ſix little Wings.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And I ſaw, and behold, from the ſix little Wings, two were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and they remained under the Head; that is, on the right ſide, for four tarried in their place.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And I ſaw, and behold the under Wings thought to ſet up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99590:9"/>and to hold the Principalities.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. And I ſaw, and behold, one was ſet up, but forthwith it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. And they that were ſecond, did ſooner vaniſh away than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>

                  <p n="31">31. And behold, the Head with them that were with him turned, and did eat the two under Wings that did think to Reign.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. And the Head terrified all the Earth, and ruled in it over them that inhabited the Earth with much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and he that held the Dominion of the whole World, above all the Kings that were.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. And I ſaw, and behold they appeared not, and all the body of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99590:11"/>Eagle was burnt, and the Earth was afraid exceedingly.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. This is the interpretation of this Viſion:</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The Eagle which thou ſaweſt coming up from the Sea, this is the Kingdom which was ſeen in a Viſion to <hi>Daniel</hi> thy Brother. [<hi>Marg. Dan.</hi> vii. 7.]</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But it was not interpreted to him, therefore I do now interpret it to thee.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Behold, the day is come, and there ſhall ariſe a Kingdom upon Earth, and the fear ſhall be more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible than all the Kingdoms that were before it.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And there ſhall twelve Kings Reign in it one after another.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. For the ſecond ſhall begin to Reign, and he ſhall continue more time than the reſt of the twelve.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. This is the interpretation of the twelve Wings which thou ſaweſt.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And the Voice that ſpake which thou heardeſt not coming forth from her Heads, but from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of her Body,</p>
                  <p n="18">18. This is the interpretation, That after the time of that Kingdom ſhall riſe no ſmall Contentions, and it ſhall be in danger to fall; and it ſhall not fall then, but ſhall be Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again, according to the beginning thereof;</p>
                  <p n="19">19. And whereas thou ſaweſt the eight under Wings cleaving to the Wings thereof.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. This is the interpretation, Eight Kings ſhall riſe in it, whoſe Times ſhall be light, and Years ſwift, and two of them ſhall periſh.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. But when the midſt time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth, it ſhall be kept till a time, when the time thereof ſhall begin to approach to be ended, yet two ſhall be kept to the end.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. And whereas thou faweſt three Heads reſting.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. This is the interpretation, In
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99590:12"/>her laſt days the Higheſt will raiſe up three Kingdoms, and will call back many things to them, and they ſhall rule over the Earth,</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And them that dwell in it, with much labour, above all them that were before them: for this cauſe they are called the Heads of the Eagle.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. For theſe ſhall be they that ſhall recapitulate her Impieties, and that ſhall accompliſh her laſt things.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. And whereas thou ſaweſt a greater Head not appearing, this is the interpretation thereof: That one of them ſhall die upon his Bed, and yet with Torments.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. For the two that ſhall remain, the Sword ſhall eat them.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. For the Sword of the one ſhall devour him that is with him, but yet this alſo at the laſt ſhall fall by the Sword.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. And whereas thou ſaweſt two under Wings paſſing over the Head, which is on the right ſide;</p>
                  <p n="30">30. This is the interpretation thereof: Theſe are they whom the Higheſt hath kept to their end; this is a ſmall Kingdom, and full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. As thou ſaweſt the Liou alſo whom thou ſaweſt awaking out of the Wood, and roaring, and ſpeaking unto the Eagle, and rebuking her and his injuſtices, by all his words, as thou haſt heard.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. This is the Wind, which the Higheſt hath kept to the end for them, and their Impieties, and ſhall rebuke them, and ſhall caſt in their ſpoils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. For he ſhall ſet them in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alive, and it ſhall be when he hath reproved them, then ſhall he chaſtiſe them.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. And I ſaw, and behold, ſhe ſpread her Wings over all the Earth, and all the Winds of the Air blew on her, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And I beheld, and out of her Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers grew out other contrary Feathers, and they became little Feathers and ſmall.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But her Heads remained ſtill, and the Head in the midſt, was greater than the other Heads, yet reſted it with them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Moreover I ſaw, that the Eagle flew with her Feathers, and reigned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, and over them that dwell therein.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And I ſaw, that all things under Heaven were ſubject unto her, and no Man ſpoke againſt her, no not one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon Earth.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I ſaw alſo, that the Eagle ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Claws, and ſpake to her Feathers, ſaying,</p>

                  <p n="12">12. And I looked, and behold, on the right ſide there aroſe one Feather, and reigned over all the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And when it had reigned, the end of it came, and the place thereof appeared no more, ſo the next ſtood up and reigned, it continued a long time.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And when it had reigned, the end of it came alſo, and as the firſt, ſo it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Then there came a Voice unto it, and ſaid,</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Hear thou that haſt kept the Earth ſo long, this I ſay unto thee, before thou beginſt to appear no more.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. There ſhall none after thee attain to thy time, nor to the half thereof.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Then aroſe the third, and reigned as the other afore, and it appeared no more alſo.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. So it came to all the others one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, ſo that every one reigned, and then appeared no more.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Then I looked, and behold, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, the Feathers that followed ſtood upon the right ſide, that they might rule alſo, and ſome of them ruled, but within a while they appeared no more.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. For ſome of them were ſet up, but ruled not.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. After this I looked, and the twelve Feathers appeared no more, nor the two Wings.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And there was no more on the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle's body but two Heads that reſted, and ſix Wings.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Then ſaw I alſo, that two Wings divided themſelves from the ſix, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained under the Head that was on the right ſide, for the four continued in their place.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. So, I looked, and behold, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Wings thought to ſet up themſelves,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99590:9"/>and to have the Rule.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Then was there one ſet up, but ſhortly it appeared no more.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. And the ſecond was ſooner gone than the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Then I beheld, and lo the two that remained, thought alſo in themſelves to Reign.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. And when they ſo thought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, there awaked one of the Heads that was at reſt, which was in the midſt, for that was greater than the two.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. And I ſaw, that two Heads were joyned therewith.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. And behold, the Head was turned with them that were with it, and did eat up the under two Wings that would have Reigned.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. But the Head put the whole Earth in fear, and bear Rule in it, over all thoſe that dwelt upon Earth with much Labour; and it had the Government of the World, more than all the Wings that had been.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. After this, I looked, and beheld the Head that was in the midſt ſuddenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no more, as did the Wings.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. But the two Heads remained, which alſo Ruled likewiſe upon the Earth, and over thoſe that dwelt therein.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. And I beheld, and lo the Head upon the right ſide devoured it that was upon the left ſide.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Then I heard a Voice, which ſaid unto me, Look before thee, and conſider the thing that thou ſeeſt.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. So I ſaw, and behold as it were a Lion that roareth, running haſtily out of the Wood; and I ſaw that he ſent out a Mans Voice unto the Eagle, and ſaid,</p>

                  <p n="2">2. And behold, the Head that had the upper hand appeared no more, neither did the four Wings appear any more, that came to it, and ſet up themſelves to Reign, whoſe Kingdom was ſmall and full of Uproars.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And I ſaw, and behold, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no more, and the whole body of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99590:11"/>the Eagle was burnt, ſo that the Earth was in great fear: Then I awaked out of the trouble and trance of my Mind, and from the great fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Then ſaid he unto me, this is he interpretation of this Viſion.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The Eagle which thou ſaweſt come up from the Sea, is the Kingdom which was ſeen in the Viſion of thy Brother <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. But it was not expounded unto him, therefore I declare it unto thee.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Behold, the days come, that there ſhall ariſe up a Kingdom upon the Earth and it ſhall be feared above all Kingdoms that were before it.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. In it ſhall twelve Kings Reign one after another.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Whereof the ſecond ſhall begin to Reign, and ſhall have more time than the twelve.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And this do the twelve Wings ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie which thou ſaweſt.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. As for the Voice which thou heardſt ſpake, and that thou ſaweſt not go out of the Heads, but from the midſt of the body thereof, this is the interpretation:</p>
                  <p n="18">18. That after the time of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, there ſhall ariſe great ſtrife, and it ſhall be in danger to fall, but it ſhall not then fall; but it ſhall be reſtored again to its beginning.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Concerning the eight under Wings, which thou ſaweſt hang under her Wings, this is the interpretation:</p>
                  <p n="20">20. In it ſhall riſe eight Kings, whoſe Times ſhall be but ſmall, and their Years ſwift, and two of them ſhall periſh.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. But when the mid-time cometh, there ſhall be four kept a time, whilſt his time beginneth to come, that it may be ended, but two ſhall be kept to the end.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. And whereas thou ſaweſt three Heads reſting, this is the interpretation:</p>
                  <p n="23">23. In her laſt days, ſhall the moſt High
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99590:12"/>raiſe up three Kingdoms, and ſhall call again many things unto them, and they ſhall have the Dominion of the Earth,</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And of thoſe that dwell therein, with much grief above all thoſe that were before them: therefore they are called the Heads of the Eagle.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. For they ſhall accompliſh its wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, and ſhall finiſh its laſt end.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. And whereas thou ſaweſt that the great Head appeared no more, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that one of them ſhall die upon his Bed, and yet with pain.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. For the two that remain, the Sword ſhall devour them.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. For the Sword of the one ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the other, but at the laſt he ſhall fall by the Sword himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. And whereas thou ſaweſt two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Wings that went off towards the Head which was on the right ſide, this is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation:</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Theſe are they whom the moſt High hath preſerved for their end, whoſe Kingdom is little and full of trouble, as thou ſaweſt.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. And the Lion which thou ſaweſt riſing up out of the Wood, and roaring and ſpeaking to the Eagle, and rebuking her for Unrighteouſneſs, with all the words which thou haſt heard.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. This is the Wind which the moſt High hath kept for them, for their Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs unto the end, and he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, and caſt before them their Spoils.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. For he ſhall ſet them alive in the Judgment, and ſhall rebuke them and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. For he ſhall deliver the reſidue of my People by Affliction, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved upon my Borders, and he ſhall make them joyful until the coming of the Day of Judgment; whereof I have ſpoken unto thee from the beginning.</p>
                  <p n="35">
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:99590:12"/> 35. This is the Dream that thou ſaweſt, and theſe are the interpretations.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. ANd it came to paſs after ſeven days, I dreamed a Dream by Night:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And lo, there aroſe a Wind from the Sea, that it moved all the Waves thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And I beheld, and lo, that Man wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrong with the thouſands of Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. This is the meaning of the Viſion; Whereas thou ſaweſt a Man coming up from the midſt of the Sea;</p>
                  <p n="26">26. The ſame is he whom God the Higheſt hath kept a great ſeaſon, which by his own ſelf ſhall deliver his Creature, and he ſhall order them that are left behind.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Behold, the days come, when the moſt High will begin to deliver them that are upon the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. And he ſhall come to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of them that dwell on the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. And one ſhall undertake to fight againſt another; one City againſt another, one Place againſt another, one People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, and one Realm againſt another.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. And the time ſhall be when theſe Things ſhall come to paſs, and the Signs ſhall happen which I ſhewed thee before; and then ſhall my Son be declared, whom thou ſaweſt as a Man aſcending.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. And when all the People hear his Voice, every Man ſhall in their own Land leave the Battel they have one againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. And an innumerable multitude ſhall be gathered together, as thou ſaweſt them willing to come, and to overcome him by fighting.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. But he ſhall ſtand upon the top of the Mount of <hi>Sion.</hi>

                  <hi>Anonymous future Hiſtory of</hi> Europe. SECT. 11.</head>
               <p>§. THe two Books of <hi>Eſdras</hi> are thought (and that by none of the leaſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe, Toſtatus, Scaliger</hi> the Elder, <hi>Melancthon, Arias Montanus, Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Bibliander</hi>) to be Canonical, becauſe of the moſt eminent fulfilling of many Predictions in them contained. In the 11th Chapter of the ſecond of thoſe Books, there is under the Type of an Eagle, a manifeſt Prophecy, both of the <hi>Roman</hi> Heatheniſh Empire, as likewiſe of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> with her chief Leaguers to this preſent Time, throughout the whole Chapter. This Eagle is the <hi>Roman</hi> Heatheniſh Empire, her twelve Feathered Wings are the twelve firſt Emperours from <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> to <hi>Nerva.</hi> The three Heads are the Kingdoms of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> preordained of God to maintain the power of her Pride, when all her Wings (her Heatheniſh and Tyrannical <hi>Caeſars</hi>) ſhould fail her. Nevertheleſs, under her twelve firſt <hi>Caeſars</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in general, all the Emperours which Reigned in her from <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> (who firſt crackt the ſtrings of her Liberty) to <hi>Auguſtulus Momyllus,</hi> (her laſt Roman <hi>Caeſar</hi>) for the ſpace of 474 Years. Her eight contrary Feathers, are the eight terrible Inundations of ſeveral Nations, from the North (God's
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99590:13"/>Scourges) which overwhelmed her faireſt Provinces, ſunk her State in Blood, and by Fire and Sword humbled her as low as the Duſt ſhe trod on, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laricus,</hi> and his Weſt <hi>Goths.</hi> 2. <hi>Attilas,</hi> and his Huns. 3. <hi>Genſericus,</hi> and his <hi>Vandals.</hi> 4. <hi>Odoacer.</hi> 5. <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> and his Eaſt <hi>Goths.</hi> 6. <hi>Totilas,</hi> and his <hi>Spaniards.</hi> 7. <hi>Alboinus,</hi> and his <hi>Longobards</hi> (who depoſed her Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive <hi>Gaeſar, Auguſtulus Momyllus.</hi>) 8. And laſtly, The inteſtine Home-bred Faction and Conſpiracy, which proved more Pernitious than the reſt (as all inteſtine Diſeaſes are the worſt) which in the Reigns of <hi>Otho</hi> the Great, <hi>Otho</hi> the III, and <hi>Frederick</hi> the II, ſo often ſtrove to eradicate the Papal Superiority, and re-edifie her <hi>S. P. Q. R.</hi> buried ſo many Ages ago, out of the Ruines of the City. The Head in the midſt, is the <hi>German</hi> Empire, begun <hi>A. C.</hi> 801, on <hi>Chriſtmas Day,</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, which though (<hi>v.</hi> 32.) it long did, and yet doth put the Earth in great fear, yet <hi>v.</hi> 33. muſt vaniſh in an inſtant, as did the Wings, and come to nought. The <hi>German</hi> Empire thus deſtroyed, <hi>v.</hi> 35. The Head on the right ſide (the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi>) muſt devour the Head on the left ſide, the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> Therefore it is manifeſt that the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> though now it flouriſheth in what Glory and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence the Earth can afford, muſt ere long be humbled by the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> with many Diſcomfitures, and brought to doleful Straits, and great Perplexities. I my ſelf have obſerved how that Year (in which the Figures of the Golden Number were equal to the Figures of the Year of Chriſt) hath ever proved Fatal to that Monarchy. It was ſo with them from 1570, to 1576: In all which ſeven Years, the <hi>Guiſian</hi> Faction made lamentable Havock of the Church of God, and the Kingdom: So ſhall it be in that Year in which the final Tragedy of that Kingdom ſhall be acted, ſix Years after which <hi>France</hi> ſhall be no more. But when that ſhall be, no ſign of <hi>Europe</hi> ſhall remain, nor remembrance where the Walls of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtood.</p>
               <p>§. 2. The Lion (which <hi>ver.</hi> 37, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 31. came roaring out of the Wood, ſpeaking to the Eagle, and rebuking her for her Wickedneſs) is the Wind which the moſt High God hath kept for <hi>Rome</hi> and her Wickedneſs, till the end, even the Lion of the North (of which you ſhall hear a Prophecy anon, of the true <hi>Merlin</hi>) which ſhall reprove the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her her Spoils: he ſhall ſet her alive in Judgment, Rebuke and Correct her, and deliver the reſt of God's People from Affliction, which are preſerved on his Borders, and make them joyful to the Day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>§. 3. In the 13th Chapter, <hi>Eſdras</hi> beholds a Viſion of a Man riſing out of the Sea, and devouring the multitude of Fighters that came againſt him, neither with Sword, Spear, nor any Inſtrument of War, but only with the Fire and Storm that came out of his Mouth; which is Chriſt the Son of Man, who through a Sea of Bloody Perſecutions and Tribulations, propagated the Goſpel over the Earth, confounding and devouring the multitudinous <hi>Pagans</hi> and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, fighting againſt Chriſtians, by the invincible force of the Goſpel. After a long time of the obſtinate wilfulneſs of the Weſtern <hi>Jews,</hi> and fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he ſhall call to himſelf another peaceable Multitude, even the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> out of <hi>Armenia, Tartaria,</hi> and the Eaſtern <hi>India,</hi> whom God ſhall defend, and convert to the Goſpel, when he ſhall deſtroy all other Nations upon Earth. Theſe are called the Peaceable People, becauſe after the Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhall come that Miniſterial Monarchy of the Church over the whole World, that peaceable, and ſtill time, when all the Nations of the Earth ſhall forget Fighting one againſt another, Wars ſhall ceaſe in all the World, and Swords and Spears ſhall be beaten into Plow-Shares and Pruning-Hooks.</p>
               <p>§. 4. When the ſeventh Angel blew his Trumpet, <hi>Luther</hi> began his Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; then it was when the Multitude ſtood before the Lamb, and ſung the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99590:14"/>new Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that nevertheleſs is but the Vail of the Tabernacle opened in Heaven, and a great Cloud and Smoke covered that Glory. But it muſt be 180 Years after,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1517"/> when the Kingdoms of this World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Kingdoms of our Lord and his Chriſt, and thoſe be deſtroyed that deſtroyed the Earth.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1697"/> For then, and not till then, ſhall the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God be fully opened in Heaven, and the Ark of his Teſtimony (the very ſame Model which God ſhewed to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount) ſhall be ſeen at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not in a Tabernacle, but in that Temple which the Power of God ſhall make. Then ſhall, laſtly, the four Beaſts, the Elders with all the Angels of Heaven, and all the Creatures of Heaven, Earth, and Sea, and under the Earth, fall down before the Throne, and give Glory, Honour, Bleſſing, and Praiſe, unto him that ſitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever; and the four Beaſts ſhall ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far that <hi>Anonymus,</hi> in his brief Expoſition on <hi>Eſdras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. If this find kind Acceptation, a fuller and more particular Expoſition of this Prophecy will be Publiſhed, which is now Collected out of ſeveral learned Commentators.</p>
               <p>If any think it improbable that the middle Head, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, can be determined and die in Torment, but not by Blood and Conqueſt, but as it were in its Bed, as is here foretold, <hi>Eſdras</hi> iv. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. On the contrary, nothing ſeems to me more probable, than that the <hi>German</hi> Princes to extricate themſelves from the Troubles the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> have brought on them, firſt by Civil Wars, and now by the Emulation that is riſen betwixt it and <hi>France,</hi> ſhould after this Emperours Death, that they might not offend <hi>France,</hi> forbear to chooſe a King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and be thence-forth governed by a Vicar, or the Diet, Parliament, or Common Council of the Empire. And it is alſo very agreeable to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecy, from whence we may expect, that there will be daily more and more Breaches made of the Weſtern Empire into ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Diviſions, but no Coalition into one Head, or Empire, till it be throughly Reformed.</p>
               <p>Our Author here, as ſome others, takes it for granted, as the Preſumptions of thoſe Times he lived in gave him confidence to believe, that <hi>Spain</hi> was the right Head, and would deſtroy <hi>France</hi> the left; whereas the contrary is in our Times much more probable: To us the matter is not worth diſputing, whether ſhall firſt periſh, ſince both muſt.</p>

            <p>THe Northern Kingdoms ſhall be waſted by Reapers; The Southern Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities ſhall end in Duſt. — Cruel Wars ſhall be ſcattered by the Winds, their growth and continuance by Baſtards — All theſe things ſhall hardly be accompliſhed when a Prince of Royal Stock ſhall come forth crowned from the Northern Parts, as to his own People unexpected, but deſired by Foraiguers, who becauſe he ſhall bear a Rampant Lion, ſhall therefore be called a <hi>Lion.</hi> He ſhall not reſt till after he hath called a Synod, and after diſſolved it by Threats he ſhall advance his Conquering Arms againſt his Enemies; and by woful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſhall harraſs the Territories of Neighbour Princes. He ſhall exceed <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great in Valour, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> in Succeſs. He ſhall croſs the Seas, and be ſaluted Emperour by many Kings; a certain ancient City ſhall he lay even with the Ground. In the interim, a warlike powerful Prince from the Eaſt ſhall provoke him to Battel, againſt whom the Lion ſhall march with all his Forces, and pitching his Camp on this ſide <hi>Euphrates,</hi> ſhall expect him.</p>
            <p>§. 7. If the Prince ſhall come over the River, the Lion ſhall be overcome, but he ſhall paſs his Army over the River, and give his Enemy a bloody Defeat, and be Maſter of all the Eaſt. Whilſt theſe things are in Action, divers Petty Kings from <hi>India,</hi> ſhall break into <hi>Syria</hi> with mighty Armies, and provided for Battel, ſhall wait for the Lion about the Valley of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> where they ſhall by him be wholly cut off.

            <p>His Prophecies are extant in the excellent Works of <hi>Francis Mirandula.</hi> He propheſied, That being the <hi>French</hi> King had neglected the Reformation of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which that holy Man exhorted him, he ſhould loſe all he had Conquered, but ſhould return in ſafety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that in the laſt Times, <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> ſhould be Converted unto Chriſt; that a Man
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99590:15"/>like <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with a numerous Army of true Profeſſors, ſhould come over the <hi>Alps</hi> and deſtroy <hi>Rome,</hi> and ruinate all the Kingdoms and States of <hi>Italy.</hi> That grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Wars, Blood-ſheddings, and Maſſacres, ſhould ariſe in the World by a Northern King, for an happy Reformation, [and conſequently to fall upon them who oppoſe it,] who ſhould carry the Goſpel out of <hi>Europe,</hi> into a vaſt and unknown World in the end of Time. [The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations and Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries in the Eaſt and Weſt, give light to this Prophecy, and hopes they may fulfil it.]</p>
            <p>§. 10. The tenth Figure in a Collection of Prophetick Emblems, (found in ſome <hi>German</hi> Libraries) of about 400 Years ſtanding, Publiſhed above 100 Years ſince, repreſents an Unicorn ramping up againſt a Pope clad in all his Pontifical Robes, and puſhing off from his Head his Triple Crown with the end of his Horn, and a Frier ſitting by upon his Knees.</p>
            <p>On this the Publiſher thus Diſcants. Since the Pope is Mighty, needs muſt there come one more Puiſſant, and Mightier than he, that ſhall lift him out of his Neſt and overcome him; and ſo ſhall the Hypocritical Devotions and Devices of his ſaveling Prieſts and Jeſuits, not be able to ſupport him.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that the Unicorn is the Supporter of <hi>Great Britain's</hi> Arms, and that it is peculiar to his Majeſty's Family, and that they brought it out of the North with them.</p>
            <p>This Collection was Tranſlated out of a <hi>German</hi> Author in <hi>Edward</hi> the 6ths time, and then Publiſhed by <hi>Walter Linn,</hi> whoſe Admonition to his Reader in thoſe tickliſh Times, as ſeaſonable for ours, <hi>See below at the end of this Book.</hi>

            <p> §. 12. Now thoſe Times are coming, in which many ſecrets of Nature ſhall be revealed.</p>
            <p>Now that fourth Monarchy of the North is about to begin. Now the time is at hand, the Mother of Sciences will come; greater things ſhall be diſcovered than have been in theſe three laſt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies. Becauſe God will plant this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy (as the Ancients have foretold) by a Prince enriched with all manner of Vertues, whom happily Time hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy brought forth. For we have in this Northern part a moſt Wiſe and Warlike Prince, whom no Monarch doth go beyond in Victories, or excel in Humanity and Piety. This Northern Monarchy God the Creator of Nature, and all things, will without doubt bring to light greater ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets in Nature, than in thoſe Times in which Tyrant and Pagan Princes reigned. But the Philoſophers reckon theſe Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies not according to the number of the more Powerful, but according to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99590:15"/>or principal Points or Quarters of the World. Firſt, The Eaſtern, after the Southern, now we have the Weſtern, and expect the laſt of the North in this Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Climate. But of theſe farther in my Book of <hi>Harmony.</hi> In this Northern Monarchy, where the Polar attraction is, Mercy and Truth (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks) ſhall meet together, Peace and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhall kiſs each other; Truth ſhall riſe out of the Earth, and Juſtice ſhall look down from Heaven. There ſhall be one Sheepfold, and one Shepherd. There ſhall then be many Arts without Envy; which I alſo do earneſtly deſire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Do thou alſo, Courteous Reader, call upon, love, and fear God, reade over my Writings diligently, and thou mayſt foretel to thy ſelf good things. And if thou ſhalt through the favour of God and help of Nature (whom thou muſt imitate) arrive to the deſired Haven of this Monarchy; then thou ſhalt ſee, and ſay, that all things that I have ſaid to thee are good and true.

            <p>§. 14. THe deſign of this Author in this his Book, appears by many Paſſages therein (which I have elſewhere tranſcribed) to be, to perſuade the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to return to their Obedience to the King and Church. In the place fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted, declaring the effects of the Blazing Comet, <hi>An.</hi> 1618. he ſaith, That as it appeared 37, or 38 Days, ſo it ſhewed that for the ſpace of 37, or 38 Years, from 1618 to 1656. Firſt, <hi>Germany, Livonia, Swedland,</hi> with other Northern parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> then <hi>Scotland, England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhould feel the terrible effects thereof in War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then he proceeds in theſe words: This Comet was ſtrengthened by a fearful Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter, An.</hi> 1616. <hi>July</hi> 18. the effects of both which not confined to <hi>Germany,</hi> &amp;c. were to end in the Judgments of God upon <hi>Europe,</hi> for neglecting the Overthrow of Antichriſt, Ruine of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Annihilation of the Sodomitical Order of the ſociety of Jeſus, and in the Extirpation of all Kingdoms, and free Eſtates of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to them, to make way for the Lion of the North to erect his Fifth, [our Fourth] Monarchy in the Aſhes of <hi>Germany,</hi> wherein ſhall be eſtabliſhed the eternal Felicity of the Church, by the Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and Fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> This he calls in the ſame Page, the Miniſterial, not Perſonal Reign of Chriſt on Earth.</p>
            <p>§. 15. <hi>Pag.</hi> 10. Out of <hi>Buxtorfs</hi> Letter to Mr. <hi>Shirley,</hi> Fellow of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledg, dated <hi>May</hi> 3. 1624. he brings in theſe words of <hi>Baudenſis,</hi> concerning the ſame Comet and Conjunction, according to the Opinion of the Northern <hi>Aſtrologers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold thou then a Prophecy (if not Apoſtolical) far beyond Aſtrological, if I miſtake not. God hath ariſen, and drawn out his Sword; there ſhall happen in theſe our European Regions, the Slaughter of People, Funerals of Kings, Subverſions of Common-wealths, Mutations of Monarchies, Maſſacres of Princes, and Illuſtrious Commanders, violent proud Councils, Treaſons, Rebellions;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99590:16"/>and in Northern parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> War, Sickneſs, Peſtilence.— Princes caſt out of their Dominions, Fathers baniſhed, Children after a long time reſtored.—This Comet alſo threatens the terrible Ruine of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Burnings in all the Cities of <hi>Europe.</hi> The Papiſtical Clergy, and eſpecially the Cardinals, ſhall be caſt down from their Dignities; the Jeſuits ſhall be every where drawn out to Death; neither ſhall the <hi>French</hi> nor <hi>Spaniards</hi> have Courage to ſave their Necks from the Halters. Futhermore, we diſcern a Kingdom to ariſe in the Holy Land, of its moſt ancient Inhabitants, which to Chriſtians ſhall be a Miracle, and to the World a Terror. And theſe ſhall ſucceed in the Revolution into a new Empire, under which ſhall be adminiſtred Univerſal Gladneſs, Joy, and Delight, to Mankind (the Wicked being every where taken away). All theſe things ſhall be effected by a certain Northern King, who ſhall miraculouſly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Peace, Religion, and Security, throughout the whole World. So far <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> in his Letter from <hi>Baudenſis</hi> and the Northern <hi>Aſtrologers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 16. The ſame <hi>Anonymous, pag.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>Paul Grebner</hi> of <hi>Miſnia,</hi> was more than an Inquiſitor into the effects of Stars; being queſtionleſs endued from above with a Prophetick Spirit.— He plainly affirms, that as <hi>England</hi> was ever a Monarchy within it ſelf, ſince it was diſcovered by the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſo ſhall it in like manner continue and remain even then, when all other Kingdoms and States in <hi>Europe</hi> are ſwallowed up of the Fourth Monarchy of the Lion of the North.— And ſaith, that <hi>Grebner</hi> never ſpeaks of <hi>England</hi> in all his famous <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> but as the moſt Warlike and Potent Kingdom of <hi>Europe, Pag.</hi> 25. He ſaith (<hi>i. Baudenſis</hi> from his Unkle <hi>Grebner,</hi> as it ſeems) that the Eclipſes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening two Years before or after 1660, portend the Mutations of all the ſeveral States of <hi>Auſtria, Sileſia, Hungary, Holland, France,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that the Revolution of Times is come, wherein they muſt give place to the Lion of the North, whoſe Scepter ſhall bruiſe their Power to nothing, and his Gauntlet lay their Forces proſtrate at his Feet.</p>
            <p>§. 17. <hi>Note well.</hi> If all other Kingdoms be ſwallowed up by this Northern Lion, ſave <hi>England</hi> only, neither <hi>France</hi> nor <hi>Holland</hi> being excepted, then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy will be too much concerned, and too nearly to ſtand ſtill, and conſequently muſt be either the Head, or ſome Confederate Limb of this Lion at leaſt; and that will yet more clearly appear by the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ditty (as he calls it) which he puts into <hi>Europe</hi>'s Mouth to ſing at that time, which by its Character ſeems to be a Fragment of the ancient <hi>Sibyline</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, for he tells not whence he or his Author had it.</p>

The <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> writes only of that Star which was ſeen at that time when he wrote this Manuſcript, but <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> a Scholar of the Illuſtrious Aſtronomer, <hi>Ticho Brahe,</hi> in his leſſer Globes dedicated to <hi>Maurice Prince</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> tells us of this in <hi>Caſiopaea,</hi> and another in the Swans breſt.</p>
            <p>Of this new Star in <hi>Caſiopaea,</hi> he ſpeaks thus:</p>

            <p>§. 24. Upon that in the Swans Breſt, he hath theſe words: <hi>Novam illam Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam (quae</hi> Anno. 1600. <hi>primum in pectore Cygni apparuit atque etiamum immota ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net) ex diligenti noſtra ad caudae lyrae lucidae obſervationem Longit.</hi> ♒ 16.15. <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tud.

            <p>I obſerved (ſaith he) that new Star (which firſt appeared in the Breſt of the Swan, in the Year 1600, and abides there unmoved unto this day) this Year 1603, and found its Latitude to be ♒ 16.15. Northern Latitude 55.30.</p>

            <p>And a little farther he ſaith,— Theſe Stars give us hope, that his other gracious Promiſe (of the Calling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he means, as appears in his Margent) ſhall be ſhortly accompliſhed. <hi>And</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>be trodden down by the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>till the time of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be fulfilled.</hi> Which certainly (ſaith the Doctor) ſhall precede the ſecond Coming of our Bleſſed Saviour; fore-runner whereof, he (Chriſt) ſaith, ſhall be ſigns in the Sun, Moon, and Stars.</p>

It muſt not therefore ſeem Contradictory, if from the ſame Stars great Confuſions, Diſtractions, and Deſtruction be ſignified to the Kingdoms of the World, or ſome of them, and yet quite contrary Settlement, Order, and encreaſe of Power to the Goſpel, the Kingdom of Chriſt in the ſame Confuſions from the ſame Stars; for the things of this World being founded on the fickle Purpoſes, Deſigns, and Counſels of inconſtant and mortal Men, all Shakings and Confuſions, do diſorder and confound them; but the things of God and true Religion, depending on more ſolid Principles, the general Good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the Glory and Counſel of God, they found Settlement and Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by God's Providence and Bleſſing, in the moſt unſettled Times; like thoſe Trees that gather faſter Rooting by ſtormy Winds.</p>
            <p>§. 32. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. Whatever may be condluded of Aſtrological Rules, this ſeems by our Experience in the effects of the aforeſaid Comet to be moſt certain, that the time and place of the appearance and motion of Comets, ſhew the place and time of their expected effects; theſe new Stars therefore as they are Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, muſt have ſignification of ſome Northern Monarchy.</p>

It ſeems at leaſt to Heathens and Unbelievers, who by Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy have made a Language of the Stars to themſelves, according to which they gueſs at, or believe they underſtand Affairs to come; God in Mercy, or Judgment, wonderfully condeſcends to give ſuch Men warnings according to their Capacities, who heed not his Word, nor the Prophecies of holy Men, which would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſent in vain unto them. Theſe Warnings therefore he ſends them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by extraordinary Stars, as at Chriſt's Birth, to the Wiſe Men of the Eaſt; ſometimes by extraordinary Inſpirations, as by <hi>Balaam;</hi> ſometimes by Viſions, as to <hi>Balaam;</hi> ſometimes by Aſtrologers, as in this caſe of theſe new Stars. But here, as I obſerved above, if Aſtrologers would conclude by thoſe they call Malevolent Aſpects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Affairs of Good, Holy, and Heroick Princes would be Unſucceſsful, they ſhould mightily miſtake. For in their Concerns, in whom God, his Glory and Kingdom is concern'd, that is Infallible:</p>

            <p>§. 34. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 4. From theſe Conſiderations, I hope, I may be partly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to conclude, that the Stars in <hi>Caſſiopaea</hi>'s Chair, and others fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, ſo obſerved by the great <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> and other Aſtronomers his Scholars, and Contemporaries and Followers, and by thoſe our Northern Wiſe Men, ſo interpreted as above, may without any great Abſurdity, be ſaid to hold ſome Analogy to that Star, which appeared to the Wiſe Men of the Eaſt at the time of our Saviour's Birth. That the ſignificator of his Life on Earth was movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, theſe the Precurſors of his Reign fixt, becauſe they were to ſignifie that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be Born, Riſen again, or Revived in the World, and particularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Situation in Heaven in theſe Northern parts of the World, about the Year 1572, or 1600, which muſt prevail over the whole World, and abide till the end of it.</p>
            <p>§. 35. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 5. I farther commend to Obſervation, from our learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Aſtronomer's Diſcourſe: That if Comets and new Stars do ſo certainly and preciſely operate according to their Place, Appearance, Time and Motion, and the latter co-operate as more particular cauſes with the Northern fixed Stars, as more general cauſes than the late frequent Comets, and the Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they ſignifie to thoſe that underſtand, give credit to them, and are under their Dominion, and not exempt by ſome ſpecial Providence, do alſo ſtrongly co-operate to the raiſing or preparing Matter for the Fourth Monarchy which we expect, and not the petty deſigns of the private Ambition of any Prince, King, or <hi>French,</hi> or other, how formidable ſoever they may ſeem at preſent, whatſoever their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy be, or whoever combine with them. Nor need any Chriſtian's Heart fail becauſe of them, their Leagues, or Unions, or whatever Confuſions we ſee, feel, or fear to be brought by them, for all theſe little or greater Commotions, Shakings, or Concuſſions of ill founded Powers and Governments, make way only for the grand Revolution, by which thoſe Things which are well founded and ſettled by Divine Decree and Providence, to work together for his Glory in the common good of Mankind, and Advancement of Chriſt's Kingdom to that End, ſhall be brought about, perfected, ſettled, and unmoveably Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And this, even in their Aſtrological way, thoſe who give credit thereto, muſt be forced to allow, or admit me to conclude, becauſe the ſuperiour new Stars fixt and of longer continuance, more mighty and univerſal operation, or ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Good, muſt needs prevail over, over-rule, and wear out, and ſo ſurvive and make uſe of the Operations of the leſſer, miſchievous, weaker, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and leſs durable Effects and Significations: Now ſuch are the Effects,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99590:19"/>or Significations, according as our learned Aſtrologers tell us of the leſſer Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, and leſs durable Appearances, Comets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> compared with the ſaid new Stars in <hi>Caſſiopaea, Cygnus,</hi> and <hi>Serpentarius,</hi> Attendants on this new Monarchy; or, as <hi>Poſtellus</hi> fains to call it, Chriſt's ſecond Birth, or new Birth of the World, or Renovation and new Edition of the Goſpel. And it is very probable, that he gave the Reformation that name of Chriſt's ſecond Birth, and return into the World, in contemplation of that new Star which was by our Northern <hi>Magi,</hi> ſo received and interpreted, as diſcovering the Fourth Monarch, and the place of his Birth, to thoſe that underſtand Heaven's Language.</p>
            <p>§. 36. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 6. Seeing then we may conclude, that whatever Commotions and Revolutions happen in the Chriſtian World, make for the intereſt of the Fourth Monarchy, how contrary ſoever they may for the preſent appear to it and its deſigns; So as that our Doctor tells us upon his Obſervation, that Comets themſelves, as in <hi>Luther</hi>'s time, and ſince, are Monitors of Eccleſiaſtical Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and thoſe for the better, to the greater Liberty and Freedom of Proteſtant Churches; and others tell us, they make way for the Fourth Monarchy. I will therefore here adventure farther, to diſcover what I have obſerved, whereby it may better appear what Church, and what Monarchy was ſignified and indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by theſe new Stars, to whoſe Intereſts all theſe Commotions muſt finally co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate. And firſt, as to the Church and Reformation pointed out by that Star in <hi>Caſſiopaea</hi>'s Chair, it is manifeſt, that it can be no other than that of the Reformed Proteſtant of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe that are protected under it, and ſubſcribe to its Confeſſion; and the Monarchy, as manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, to be the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> united in the Perſon of King <hi>James</hi> in one Monarch, to which <hi>France</hi> and the other Reformed Churches there, as of right they ought, ſo will in due time be united; the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition being much more Natural and Facile from the <hi>French</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Liberty, than from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> Dominion. For upon view of our Church Hiſtory, I find that the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> being the common Confeſſion of the Reformed Proteſtants, to which with very few grains of Allowance, as well <hi>Calviniſts</hi> as <hi>Lutherans,</hi> may without ſcruple indifferently ſubſcribe, were formed in the Convocation at <hi>London</hi> 1563, in which the Reverend, Pious, and Learned <hi>Alexander Nowel,</hi> Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> was Prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor; and the ſame were in the Year 1571, by Soveraign Authority enacted and eſtabliſhed to be the publick Confeſſion of the Engliſh Church, in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 37. And about the ſame time a Catechiſm, agreeable to the ſame Articles, was Publiſhed, and by Authority enjoyned to be taught in Schools, with this Title, <hi>Catechiſmus brevis Chriſtianae diſciplinae ſummam continens, omnibus Ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magiſtris Authoritate R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>Of the Articles, a late Church Hiſtorian hath theſe words: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſet forth in Print in the Year of Chriſt 1571, when they were firſt Ratified by Act of Parliament, whoſe being as obligatory, bears not date nine Years before from their compoſition in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, but hence from their Confirmation in Parliament. So that there was hardly a Years difference betwixt the publication of the Articles of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church to the World, and the appearance of that Star in the Chair of <hi>Caſſiopaea,</hi> giving the whole World warning, and the Wiſe Men aim to look our for ſome ſecond glorious diſcovery of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>§. 38. And as for the Monarchy of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that was yet more Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the appearing of two new Stars, the one two or three Years before, and the other a Year or two after the Union of the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Perſon of King <hi>James.</hi> That which was the Precurſor and Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (as it were) of this Northern Monarchy, was the forementioned Star in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99590:19"/>the Breaſt of the Swan 1600; and that which followed and attended on it, was the Star in the foot of <hi>Ophinchus,</hi> in the Year 1604. Nor can I ſee why any ſhould condemn him of Preſumption, who ſhould from the Analogy of the Star in the Eaſt, directing the Wiſe Men of thoſe parts to the King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> our Saviour, born about that time, argue that the uſe of theſe may probably be, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew to the Wiſe of our Times and Parts, when and where the true Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Reforming Monarchy muſt riſe. For as the Star in the Chair of <hi>Caſſiopaea,</hi> one of the moſt glorious in the Heavens, (generally ſpeaking) and amongſt the moſt Glorious, thoſe of the North, more eſpecially, and the moſt conſpicuous part of that Conſtellation; her Chair it ſelf moſt reſplendent, was moſt proper to ſignifie the ſecond Edition (as I may ſay) or new Birth of the Goſpel, or ſecond Birth of Chriſt, as <hi>Poſtellus</hi> would have it; brought into the World by a Virgin Queen, about the time of that Stars appearance, and then ſpread newly all over <hi>Europe,</hi> as it had been conceived by her Authority ſome nine Years before. So in like manner the Star in the Breaſt of the Swan, and that other in the foot of <hi>Serpentarius,</hi> attending at like diſtance on the Birth of our Britiſh Monarchy, are as appoſite to demonſtrate it to our Northern Wiſe Men, that of the Swans Breaſt, its time and place, and that in <hi>Serpentarius</hi> foot, its principal deſign and work, namely, the ruine of that Serpentine Brood, which are the preſent ſupport and foot of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, their Home and Harbour; and Hope, Keeper, Holder up, and Maintainer of the Serpent and his Kingdom, which he pretends unto in Heaven, the Temple and Church of God. I ſay again, That as the Star in <hi>Caſſiopaea</hi>'s Chair, <hi>An.</hi> 1572, ſhewed where, when, and by whom the ſecond Edition of the Goſpel, or ſecond Birth of Chriſt's Kingdom was wrought, namely, here in this Iſland, by a Virgin Queen; who in the Year 1571, Enacted the true Reformed Chriſtian Faith. So the Star in the Swans Breaſt 1600, and <hi>Serpentarius</hi> foot 1604, ſhews what Kingdom and Family muſt extinguiſh by the luſtre of that Reformation, the Superſtitions and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Rome,</hi> and give that blow with a Stone, cut out without Hands from the Mountain, on the feet of the laſt Supporter of Satan's Kingdom, the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy; being alſo the baſeſt and worſt conſtituted of incoherent Iron and Clay, and grind it to Duſt, and diſperſe the Remnants of it to all the Winds, as <hi>Daniel</hi> propheſies.</p>
            <p>§. 39. There being the ſame reaſon for us to look out for ſome new Kingdom in theſe Northern parts, to which theſe Stars were perpendicular, as there was for thoſe Wiſe Men in the Eaſt, to look for a King born in <hi>Judea,</hi> by the Star they ſaw in the Eaſt. Nor doth the moveableneſs of that, and fixedneſs of theſe, make as to our purpoſe any conſiderable difference; for it was neceſſary that thoſe Eaſtern <hi>Magi,</hi> who ſought one particular Perſon, ſhould be guided by a Star ſo moveable, that its perpendicular Rays might point out <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and our Bleſſed Saviour's Perſon to them, that they might bring to him their Gold and other Treaſures: But to diſcover to our Wiſe Men in the North, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to which the Honour is reſerved in this laſt and worſt Age, to reform the Religion and Manners of the whole World according to Chriſt's Rule, both for Spirituals and Civils, it ſufficed that ſuch new Stars did appear unto them fixed in the Starry Orb, as by their motion therewith might deſcribe a Circle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in at the time of their appearance, that Reformation and Kingdom did firſt riſe and appear. Now if we enquire what Reformation did appear in the World, about the time of the appearance of the Star in <hi>Caſſiopaea</hi>'s Chair near the Circle its direct Rays did deſcribe upon the Globe on the Earth, we ſhall find that of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and no other. And again, if we ſeek what Kingdom did ariſe about that time the Star firſt appeared in the Swans Neck, within the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Circle deſcribed by its perpendicular Beams, we ſhall find no other than the Monarchy of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> then founded by King <hi>James,</hi> and tranſmitted from
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99590:20"/>him to our preſent Soveraign <hi>Charles</hi> the II, the firſt of Engliſh Birth, who ſway'd the Scepter. Allowing what thoſe ancient Prophecies here ſubſcribed:</p>

ACcording to the Confeſſion of the <hi>Italian</hi> Jeſuit <hi>Hieronimus Platus,</hi> in the 2d Book of the <hi>Religious Life,</hi> and 30th Chapter, <hi>England</hi> hath been more fertile of Converters of Countries and Nations to the Chriſtian Faith, than any other Land whatſoever elſe: So is it not unlikely, but that God will have the ſame Country to be more fertile of many Reformers, and other corrupt Churches, eſpecially that of <hi>Rome,</hi> than any other Land whatſoever; and to reclaim <hi>Rome</hi> and her Daughters from their Abuſes and Corruption, and to reſtore unto them their Primitive Purity and Integrity, ſuch as it was in the days of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, Born in <hi>Great Britain.</hi>

            <p>§. 44. So <hi>Noſtradamus</hi> predicts, That <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be ruled by the Britaniſh Head. In his firſt Century he ſaith, that the new King that joyns the lower and Northern Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſhall be the Inſtrument of loſs to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> together with his Clergy, except they ſhew themſelves willing to be reformed, ſhall be made to ſpit Blood, when the Roſe ſhall flouriſh.</p>
            <p>He promiſeth in his 5th Century, that of the Trojan Blood, ſhall ſpring a

            <p>§. 45. Out of the Library of St. <hi>Victor,</hi> cited by the Abbot of <hi>Cluny,</hi> it's ſaid, Abbot <hi>Joakim</hi> ſaid, That the Red Roſe ſhould ſend forth the ſweet Water, that ſhall purifie and cleanſe the Church from her Corruption.</p>

               <p>§. 51. <hi>JOhn Urſinus,</hi> in his <hi>Roman Conclave,</hi> Printed in <hi>London,</hi> in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1600. <hi>Pag.</hi> 142. in the Chapter of <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th, upon the Deceaſe of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> the firſt Emperour of <hi>Germany; Charles</hi> the 5th, afterwards Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> were Competitors for the Imperial Diadem; <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th, then Pope, in Bar of <hi>Charles,</hi> pleaded, That <hi>Charles</hi> by no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure prediction and lineamental diſcription of Face and diſpoſition, reſembled the Man, foretold in certain Verſes of an ancient Prophet, who ariſing in the North, ſhould be the mover of grievous Alterations to fall upon <hi>Italy,</hi> but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>This Prophecy had ſome weak Deſcriptions it ſeems, of the Perſon expected from the North, to make ſuch great Alterations in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea; and <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th, ſome reſemblance of that Perſon. And my Author by his Note in the Margent, allowing the Prophecy to be truer than the Pope was aware, thereby intimates that the Alterations wrought in <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifths time, had ſome agreement to the ſcope of the Prophecy. But the Reader, if he well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the words of the Prophet as here related, may very eaſily conclude, That <hi>Charles</hi> who was rather a Southern than Northern Man, and made no ſuch grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Alterations neither in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea it ſelf, as the Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, and the Pope feared was not the Man of whom the Prophet ſpoke; and that this Prophecy may therefore be very well added upon the Popes Teſtimony againſt his own Sea, to the foregoing, to ſhew that a Northern Prince will riſe and make more grievous Alterations there than thoſe of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifths time. Nor do they fear the Reformation <hi>Luther</hi> then began in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſo much as what the Northern Monarchy will make in <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf.</p>

            <p>§. 57. What he hath here foretold of the damage done to the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and their Confederates, where he places them in the Front be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>French,</hi> was long ſince fulfilled; of which <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> are ſufficient Teſtimonies. For what he foretold of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> We know ſhe held Towns there as long as ſhe lived, and had ſhe not refuſed them, the whole <hi>Netherlands</hi> would have caſt themſelves into her Lap, and to her aſſiſtance given them. And <hi>France</hi> it ſelf againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> the firſt declination of that Monarchy muſt be attributed; and how deadly Blows the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have ſince given it, to their own prejudice, and that of Chriſtendom, is largely ſhow'd by a late Pen in his Paper, entituled, <hi>The World deceived in</hi> Oliver Cromwel.</p>
            <p>§. 58. This indeed <hi>Grebner</hi> did not foreſee, that I can perceive in his Book, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> himſelf ſhould yield up <hi>Flanders,</hi> or any part of it to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> to be protected againſt the Enemies of his Crown; and it ſounds as unlikely as what that odd Rime imported:
<q>
                  <l>Believe this true, when as you ſee</l>
                  <l>A <hi>Spaniard</hi> Proteſtant to be.</l>
               </q>
            </p>

            <p>§. 75. THere are ſome pious Souls amongſt us, who have ſeen Viſions, and dreamed Prophetick Dreams of the heroick Actions and Succeſs of our Lion in the Eaſt, as well as Weſtern Empire; but their Modeſty hath in a great part ſuppreſſed them, and I have no warrant to Publiſh them imperfect, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the notices I have of them. Therefore,</p>
            <p>I will conclude theſe Predictions of the Fourth Monarchy, promiſed to the Northern Lion, with a Relation I had from a Learned and Pious Friend, lately deceaſed, which was this: That ſome Months before the death of <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> or ſhortly after; a Servant of his nearly related to him, ſaw in a Night Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in a Room not unlike the Banqueting-Houſe at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> the Crown Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial of <hi>England</hi> on a fair Table, covered with a rich Carpet; to which, placed at the upper end of the Table, <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi> approached; but inſtead of taking it up in his Hand, and placing it on his Head, as the Spectator hoped, he put it down from the Table with his Head; upon which, his Father ſuddenly draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide the Curtain at the upper end of the Room, which covered him, and the Throne erected there from Obſervation, reproaching his Son for his folly, and ſtamping at him with great Indignation, for loſing three Crowns which he had ſo fairly, as he ſaid, procured for him, vaniſhed away, and his Son with him.</p>
            <p>Shortly after his Majeſty that now is, <hi>Charles</hi> the II, entered the Room, took up the Crown, and having placed it on his Head, ſat down upon the Throne, to whom an audable Voice was ſent from above, in theſe words,
<q>
                  <hi>Do Juſtice, and ſhew Mercy, and thou ſhalt Reign till</hi> Shiloe <hi>come.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This may alſo ſerve for an Introduction to thoſe Prophecies, which do favour not only the North, but the Kingdom of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> in hopes of erecting this Fourth Univerſal Monarchy.

               <l>I ſaw an Angel, who did ſhew to me</l>

            </lg>
            <p>§. 85. And here it need not ſeem ſtrange, that I adjoyn ſome Viſions and Prophecies of our poor deſpiſed Britiſh Countryman, <hi>Ariſe Evans:</hi> for by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring what I have of him at hand with others, I find that neither in number, clearneſs, particularneſs of Viſions and Predictions, nor in ſpeed or certainty of Events predicted, is he in any thing inferiour to <hi>Merlin, Grebner, Ponatovia, Savanarola, Drabritius,</hi> or any other Ancient or Modern Seer of that ſort. His
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99590:25"/>particular Applications of Scripture, which ſeem moſt harſh, and Prophanations to ſome, had they been made and poliſhed with the Art and Induſtry of a learned Head and Hand, would have amounted to no more than what the Apoſtle affirms, That the <hi>Jews</hi> were our Types; that whatever happened to them, was for our Inſtruction and Comfort, both ſo brought about by God's Providence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by his Spirit. So that as there is no Caſe of Conſcience which is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in Scripture, ſo neither is there any Caſe of publick diſtreſs, whereunto there is not ſuch a Parallel found in Scripture Hiſtory, or Prophecy, as may not only give the diligent Enquirer inſtruction in what ought to be done by publick Societies, or Perſons in ſuch Diſtreſſes, and ſufficient Conſolation in greateſt and moſt deſperate Extremities; but a fore-ſight alſo, and that certain, of the Event, either to Ruine, or Deliverance. That ſuch an Ideot as <hi>Evans,</hi> fell upon, and ſo ſhrewly applied ſome particular Prophecies to thoſe Times particularly in which he ſpoke, as it ſeems ſtrange; ſo it ſhews that he had ſome Guide more than common, Angel, or Spirit, or whatever it was. And by the rule he gives to try Spirits and Prophecies, in his <hi>Eccho,</hi> printed 1653. <hi>Pag.</hi> 64, and 65. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Aſtrological Predictions, Pag.</hi> 83, 84. I find he gave no farther credit to his own Predictions, than he could find ſome pattern for them in Scripture Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in like Caſes. And one of the moſt ſhrewd amongſt theſe, we have here inſerted, having the advantage of <hi>Riſe Evans</hi> in Stile and Education, pretends no other authority for his Predictions, than that God doth follow the ſame rule in his Adminiſtration of the publick Affairs of <hi>England</hi> by his Providence at this day, he had obſerved, and ſet down in Scripture for our Inſtruction in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Old Teſtament, which he had found to be ſo infallible a Rule, that he doubted not to Predict both to the Rump, and <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> their ſpeedy Ruine, and ſometimes boldly limited them a ſhort time; as I could evince, had I his Books at command.</p>
            <p>This may ſerve to invite the Readers patience in his peruſal, of what I have excerped out of <hi>Ariſe Evans,</hi> till I come in the other parts to examine more ſtrictly theſe Prophets or Prodigies.</p>
            <p>§. 86. This ſilly Artiſan, having with ſtrange confidence predicted the King's Death by the hand of his Enemies, and that unavoidable, and ſet it twice under his hand in Writing, left one of thoſe Papers in the Chappel at <hi>Somerſet</hi> Houſe, and delivered another to Secretary <hi>Windebank,</hi> with his own Hand, when he was about to Examine him on the firſt, which he had before in charge againſt him; he was put and kept Priſoner in the <hi>Gate-Houſe</hi> three Years, as he had predicted in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1635, and being cloſe Priſoner there, had the following Viſion, which he thus deſcribes in his <hi>Eccho, Pag.</hi> 72.</p>
            <p>As I was deſiring of God to ſhew me a figure of the Judgment that was to come, and of the Glory that ſhould follow, I fell into ſuch a Trance, that I ſeemed to be in <hi>[Merioneth-ſhire,]</hi> where I was brought up at <hi>Maiſellan Kadder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſe,</hi> [<hi>Anglice,</hi> Ariſe Charles Church in Field]; And behold, I was with my Elder Brother by the ſide of the River [<hi>Dey ſunny,</hi> i. <hi>Sunny day,</hi> which comes from a Fountain called <hi>Biſhops Well,</hi> in a Hill in the North-eaſt, called <hi>Kader u duruſe, i.</hi> Ariſe the Houſe of <hi>Charles,</hi>] and it ſeemed to me a glorious day; and about two in the Afternoon, on a ſudden my Brother was gone: [This he interprets to be Chriſt's departing and abſenting himſelf for a ſeaſon,] I know not how, nor where; and as I lifted up my Eyes, the Sun by degrees became dark, ſo that the Stars appeared about it. [By appearance of Sun and Stars in darkneſs, he underſtands the deſtruction of the King and Nobles, <hi>Pag.</hi> 73.] At which darkneſs, the Sheep did cry, and run to ſeek ſhelter, as they uſe to do in thoſe parts when a Darkneſs comes before a Storm, in the holes of the Rocks. [<hi>Pag.</hi> 74. He calls it <hi>Graig wen, i.</hi> the White Rock, becauſe its Stones are white: And the foot of it, <hi>Gale ronnw, i.</hi> they will give Light, and ſaith,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99590:25"/>that over this was the Sun when it became dark upon it; theſe Sheep he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets to be God's People, that adhered to God and the King.] And all the Light of Heaven was taken away, that it became ſo dark as Pitch; then appeared by a Mad-man's Houſe, that lived there when I was a Boy, a great Bon-fire, and People making Merry about it. [This Mad-mans Houſe was under <hi>y Graig goch, i.</hi> the Red Rock on the South ſide of <hi>Sunny-Day</hi> River, the Stones thereof are red like Blood; he interprets it to ſtand for the South part of <hi>England, Pag.</hi> 74. And them at the Mad-mans Houſe that made themſelves a Bon-fire, to ſignifie an adverſe Power ſet up without God's Approbation, Standing directly oppoſite on the contrary ſide of the <hi>Sunny-Day</hi> River to <hi>Bringrugog,</hi> the dry Hill, whence Relief came to reſtore the King, <hi>i. Scotland,</hi> as he ſhews afterwards.] But as I ſtill waited and looked for ſome Light above, I eſpied a little white Cloud breaking forth in the North-eaſt. [This North-eaſt Hill from whence this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Appearance came, was <hi>Kadder û du ruſe, i.</hi> Ariſe the Houſe of <hi>Charles,</hi> the higheſt Hill in <hi>Britain,</hi> and as he ſuppoſes in all the World; in which Hill is the ever-running <hi>Biſhops Well,</hi> whence the <hi>Sunny-Day</hi> River hath its head ſource, <hi>Pag.</hi> 73.] After that the Skie appeared, and on it the King's Arms, as it is upon Blew in ſome Churches, and it rid upon the Heavens very terribly towards the South-weſt. [The appearance from the North-eaſt, did ſignify the King's Riſing again, and coming upon his Enemies from that Coaſt, <hi>Pag.</hi> 73. Now the South-weſt, againſt which the King's Arms rode upon the Heavens ſo terribly, he interpreteth <hi>Pag.</hi> 74, to be the Red Rock on the South ſide of the River aforeſaid, where the Bon-fire was kindled; and North, but more Weſtward; <hi>Moil-dunkyra, i.</hi> Baal kindle Fire, and ſtands for <hi>Ireland.</hi>] And as the Light appeared, abundance of Water ſprung out of a dry Hill Northward. [<hi>Pag.</hi> 74. He interprets this dry Hill (from whence he ſaw the Springs of Water guſh out on the North ſide of the River <hi>Sunny-Day,</hi> and oppoſite to the Southern Red Rock, and Houſe of the Mad-man, and Bon-ſire, with them that rejoyced at the deſtruction of the King and Nobles) by the name of <hi>Bringrugog, i.</hi> Gogs ſtrong Hill, to be <hi>Scotland;</hi> for Gog, ſaith he, is the chief Prince of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> quoting <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.2, 3, 6. 2 <hi>Eſdras</hi> 13.5, 6, 7.]</p>
            <p>§. 87. This Viſion ſeen in <hi>Aug.</hi> 1635. when he was a Priſoner for his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God's Juſtice upon theſe Kingdoms for their Sins, ſo long before the <hi>Iriſh</hi> kindled the Fire, or the <hi>Scots,</hi> or South of <hi>England</hi> combined againſt the King; and when there was no appearance by any humane Sagacity, that the <hi>Gold Streamers</hi> (as they were called) under General <hi>Monk</hi> from <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhould encreaſe to ſuch ſtrength, mingling with the <hi>Sunny-Day</hi> River, from <hi>Biſhops Well i.</hi> the Royal Party, as to build what they had overthrown, deſerves in my apprehenſion, not only to be received as a Voice from Heaven, by what Spirit or Inſtrument ſoever miniſtred or uttered, but is to me a Pledg and Earneſt, that what hath been acted here in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> the little World, will in God's time, and probably very ſhortly, be acted over again, and perfectly fulfilled on the Stage of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> firſt, and conſequently in the Univerſal World; and that the Monarchs of <hi>Great Britain</hi> ſhall be as remarkable in that grand, as in this leſſer Revolution.</p>
            <p>This brief account I am contented to give the Reader of this Viſion here, that I might not too much treſpaſs upon his Patience. I purpoſe in the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to ſet down this Viſion in the Author's words, and the Expoſition thereof at large, and my Thoughts of it, and a Compariſon of it with the other moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Prophecies here above collected, who have the ſame Notions of the North, South, and Weſt, as <hi>Evans.</hi>

            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:99590:26"/>
            <p> It ſeemed to me, that I was in a very little white Chamber alone, and as I looked about me, the Chamber grew bigger and bigger, until at laſt it became a great Garden that contained all the World, and I could ſee no end of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 77. He interprets this Viſion thus:</p>
            <p>Now the little Chamber, and the growth of it, ſignifies the Kingdom of Chriſt growing from hence until it contain the World. From hence, <hi>i. Great Britain.</hi> His meaning is more plainly ſet out by him, <hi>Pag.</hi> 50, 51. where reproving <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> then a State, for its Sins, he hath theſe Paſſages:</p>
            <p>Their Valour (ſpeaking of the Army) being found ſo that no Sword could overcome them, until the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.17. came againſt them; to which Sword they ſuddenly and willingly ſubmit. And I ſee by the Word of God, as I have manifeſtly proved, that we of this State are the greateſt Sinners that ever were; <hi>But where Sin aboundeth, Grace abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much more,</hi> Rom. 5.20, 21. That as Sin hath abounded unto Death, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and Diviſion amongſt us, ſo now the Grace of Repentance in this ſtate, and ſubmiſſion unto the Lord's Anointed, [underſtand him, firſt to Chriſt, and to the King for Chriſt's ſake] might bring us to Love and Union, and to act in Righteouſneſs unto Eternal Life, by the Power of God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in us.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is ſaid of this State, <hi>Dan.</hi> viii. 23. <hi>That it ſhall be broken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands.</hi> 2 Theſſ. ii. 8. <hi>And the Lord ſhall conſume it with the Spirit of his Mouth.</hi> (Underſtand him of what ever is Antichriſtian in it.)

It follows,</p>
            <p>And ye, <hi>Pope, Turk,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that keep out the Word of God, leſt it ſhould diſcover your Sins, know for a truth, that the ſame Word ſhall make a Breach into your Kingdoms, and deſtroy you; ſo that you ſhall have no cauſe to glory at the Fall of the King of <hi>England,</hi> for he ſhall be raiſed far above you. And therefore the beſt way for you to eſcape, is to joyn your ſelves with him, and let the Word of God have free paſſage amongſt you, and reform your Law by his Law, <hi>&amp;c. Pag.</hi> 51.</p>
            <p>§. 89. <hi>Pag.</hi> 77. another Viſion that I had, 1650. It ſeemed to me that I was in <hi>France,</hi> and went through all the Cities thereof, until I came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and when I came thither, me-thought I was troubled with great Waters; but at laſt as I went through the City, a Voice came to me, ſaying, So far as thou art come, ſo far ſhall one <hi>Cromwel</hi> come. This he interprets.</p>
            <p>That as <hi>Joab</hi> by <hi>David</hi>'s encouragement, went and ſmote the Jebuſites at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo ſome Perſon commanding under the King, ſhall go to <hi>Rome</hi> and ſmite the Jeſuits. Now as to the name of <hi>Cromwel</hi> given this General, if it were not conditional as to that Family, if they had reſtored the King, and been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for their pains with the Command of his Army as General, nor belong to ſome other Noble Perſon of that Name [as there is a Lord of that Name derived from <hi>Cromwel,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> ſo Famous in King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8ths time, and fatal to <hi>Rome,</hi>] it muſt ſignifie ſome bold and ſucceſsful Engliſh General, and his Army ſuch as <hi>Cromwel</hi> poſſibly might be General of about the time of this Viſion; or Men of ſuch Spirits or Principles, as they then were. For many times in theſe Writers, names of Perſons and Families (as <hi>Frederick,</hi> and <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> for Example) ſignifie not thoſe Perſons themſelves, but <hi>Frederick</hi> the Proteſtant party in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Popiſh.

            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:99590:26"/>
            <p> And whatever the name <hi>Cromwel</hi> here imports, the Paſſages following tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed out of his Voice from Heaven, Printed with his <hi>Eccho</hi> aforeſaid 1653, ſhews that he did foreſee the deſtruction of <hi>Rome</hi> by ſuch hands. <hi>Pag</hi> 21. from <hi>Amos</hi> 9.11, 12.

TO theſe Prodigious Viſions, I may properly enough refer, and here with them, record the no leſs miraculous Prophetical and Prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Appearances, not unlike Viſions, ſeen in a Stone of the Agat ſort, of an Aſh gray colour, drawing towards a Blew, given in for an advantage to his Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as a Curioſity only of little value, with a parcel of other Stones ſold to <hi>Eylers</hi> of <hi>Hamborough,</hi> about the Year 1600, and now, or lately in the poſſeſſion of Mr. <hi>Martin Eylers,</hi> a Perſon well known, as I am informed, in ſome Princes Courts in <hi>Germany,</hi> Son, Grandchild, or deſcended from the firſt Purchaſer aforeſaid, who hath ſhewed it to many at his Lodgings in <hi>Carter-Lane,</hi> near <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> and elſewhere in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Stone is of an Oval form, of the breadth of a Silver Two-pence, of the thickneſs of a Copper Farthing; its ground is Aſh colour, as hath been ſaid; but it is flecked and dapled as it were on the one ſide, after the manner of ſome Agats, with a whitiſh Cloud of the exact ſhape of an Head and Neck, with a full half-ſide Face turned towards the right Hand. The Ground is tranſparent, when held againſt the Light, but the Head drawn thereon is not. This Stone having been long (about 80 Years, as I have ſaid) in this Family of <hi>Eylers,</hi> and ſometimes ſet in a Ring, yet nothing was obſerved in it ſave that white cloudy unknown Face, till ſome Years after the Treaty at <hi>Munſter;</hi> when firſt the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Nuncio there, afterwards Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7th, became famouſly known in <hi>Germany,</hi> and all over <hi>Europe;</hi> he firſt, and then others, were noted by them who knew him, and them Perſonally, and by their Pictures or Medals, to be exactly repreſented in this Stone, according to the remarkable features of their Faces. Yet were not the greater part of them diſcovered, till about ten Years ago, and ſince that time, ſome yet unknown Faces and Appearances are diſcerned therein. Thoſe that are generally known, or have been diſcerned and known by Travellers are, 1. The aforeſaid large half Face, to be the Image of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7th, with his Head and Neck, wherein all the other Faces on that ſide are contained, being made up of ſome part of his ſaid Head, Face, or Neck, according as it is differently expoſed to the light and tranſpoſed, or view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whole, or partly covered. 2. In the ſide of his Cheek the next largeſt Face is ſeen, being three quarters of the Face of, <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> the preſent Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> whoſe Features are very remarkable. 3. In the top of the Popes Head, is the full Head and Face of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14th, the preſent King of <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:99590:27"/>holding the Pope's Head in its right Situation, but in the ſame place by turning the Pope's Head downwards and Neck upwards. 4. The preſent Dauphin of <hi>France</hi> is ſeen. 5. Behind in the hinder part of the Pope's half Head, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where therein, ſundry other Princes are plainly diſcerned, but drawn ſo cloſe one upon anothers Cheek, as it were Scale upon Scale, that ſome weak Eyes cannot diſcern them diſtinctly, unleſs ſome part of the Pope's Head, which makes up other Features, be covered. Amongſt them <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> is very remarkable. 6. After him is his Neighbour, the Duke of <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> 7. and the Emperours of <hi>Tartaria, Perſia,</hi> and others of the remote parts of the World, partly unknown, as I am informed. 8. The Emperour of <hi>Turky</hi>'s Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with his Turbant and an Half-Moon thereon, make up the finiſhing and laſt lines of the Pope's Neck; ſo that the Papacy making as it were the Body, the <hi>Turk</hi> and the King of <hi>France,</hi> are as it were the Poles of this Map of the Worlds Monarchs.</p>
            <p>§. 91. After the ſeveral different Reſemblances of ſo many diſtinct, known, and unknown Faces, were found on the Pope's ſide of this Stone, the Owner was deſirous to try if the other ſide, which was yet rough and unpoliſhed, would produce any thing, and gave it unto a Workman; who upon a Mill, ſuch as is uſed for poliſhing of Diamonds, wrought it down ſo long, till there roſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the appearance of an Angel in a long Robe, holding a Flower as it were a Scepter in his Hand. But this appearance being not white after the manner of the Cloud on the contrary ſide, but darker, and the Hand, or ſome other part of the Angel unperfect: The Owner and Workman, thinking by farther poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to bring this Angel to better Colour, Form, and Perfection, applied it again to the Wheel, which by two turns only, quite ground out the Image of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and wholly fruſtrated their expectation, and diſcouraged them from work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any farther on that ſide, fearing to loſe what was (as it ſeems) hid under that Angel; and now appeared not ſhadowed, in a white Cloud, as the Faces on the Pope's ſide, but drawn as it were to the Life, in painting Colours; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the two oppoſite Oval-ends of the Stone, where the Angel's Head and Feet did appear before, the Reſemblances of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>Oliver Cromwel.</hi> The Face of King <hi>Charles</hi> was of a pale, wan, and not lively Colour and hew, but his Features exactly and perfectly repreſented, with the Hair of his Face rough, as they Painted him, who imitated the Pictures drawn of him ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his Death, in painting Colours, and his Neek alſo bloody red, as if he had been newly Beheaded.</p>
            <p>By turning down his Picture on the oppoſite end of the Oval, appeared the reſemblance of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> painted to the Life, with a red flaming Noſe and Countenance, his Head bare, but Armed downwards from his Shoulders, and there rounded of, no other armed Picture on either ſide.</p>
            <p>The Owner hath expoſed this Stone to ſale at <hi>Rome,</hi> and elſe-where, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a greater rate than any Chapman thinks reaſonable to be given for ſuch a Curioſity.</p>
            <p>It is believed, that if the Owner durſt gently rub the Angel ſide, and poliſh it a little more, the Picture of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, would appear perfectly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which now is ſcarce diſcernable, ſave only by ſuch excellent Eyes as have been uſed to draw Work, or Paint in minuture. Becauſe,</p>
            <p>§. 92. It happens alſo in the ſame manner on the other ſide, that ſome Faces are diſcerned by good Eyes, which are altogether imperceptible to them of weak ſight. For my part, I rather believe, that if the Angel had not been poliſhed off, beſides theſe two Images which now appear, as the contrary Poles of the Proteſtant Reformed World, other Faces would have been diſcovered in his Robe, and other parts of that Image, as probably the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> at leaſt, though the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in their Perſecuting vain, may juſtly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99590:27"/>expect to be devoured themſelves in the <hi>Babylonian Romiſh</hi> Confuſions, whilſt they ſeek to Devour and Perſecute other Proteſtants more fiercely and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in ſome places, than the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves in <hi>Germany,</hi> and have by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Vehemency, deſtroyed in a manner all the Churches of their own Confeſſion in <hi>Lithuania,</hi> protected by the Reformed Gentry there, ſo long as they would own their friendly Accommodation and Comprehenſion, whereby they brought them to partake equally with themſelves in the publick legally eſtabliſhed Liberty, which is by their froward needleſs Separation, much weakned and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered at this Day.</p>
            <p>That neither the Princes, nor States of <hi>Italy,</hi> nor the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor <hi>Portugal,</hi> are ſeen in the other ſide of the Stone, may be from this Reaſon; That <hi>Spain</hi> is comprized under the Emperour, in the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> under the Pope, as chief Heads; and the States having no certain Princes, can have no Repreſentatives in theſe Maps of the oppoſite Worlds, neither on the one ſide nor the other.</p>
            <p>I have propoſed my thoughts, let every one Philoſophize thereon after his manner freely, I oblige none to my Conjectures.</p>
            <p>§. 93. 1. That which is to my preſent purpoſe, and I would farther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the Reader's conſideration concerning this Stone, its Deſcription and Hiſtory, is, That it ſeems to have been produced either by the immediate Finger of God, or by his Hand-maid Nature, wonderfully and curiouſly guided by his Providence, as in the exquiſite Needle Work (ſo the Pſalmiſt's <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath it) of Man's Body formed in the Womb. We reade in Hiſtory, that King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> had a Stone in which were ſome Reſemblances, which thoſe Times would needs attribute to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the <hi>Nine Muſes;</hi> but the Circumſtances conſidered, this Stone is in many particulars far more curious and admirable, which I need not ſpecifie, the Reader will eaſily collect its prerogatives above that of King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and from its ſingular and admirable Properties, be incited not to diſpiſe his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence whoſe Finger produced it.</p>
            <p>§. 94. 2. As I have above noted, that this Britiſh Monarchy hath by its Mottoes on its Silver and Gold Coin, current all over the World, proclaimed it ſelf to be the Kingdom of Chriſt, by owning his Croſs for its Standard, and him under God, its ſupreme Hope and Guide; and by the glorious Stars and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Heaven, our Reformation and Kingdoms were proclaimed from the Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Court, and declared to the World to be owned by God as his: So our heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angel Gold Coin, and Badges of the Honourable Order of the Garter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Battel of <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dragon, (though hid under the title of an unknown St. <hi>George</hi>) interprets what Angel it is that hath hitherto, though unknown, protected and fought for, and will hereafter, though inviſible, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, aſſiſt, and promote this Britiſh Reformation and Monarchy, againſt the Plots of <hi>Rome,</hi> and force of all Idolatrous Mahometan and Heathen Tyrannies; namely, that very <hi>Michael,</hi> who with his Angels fought againſt Satan and his Angels, and did at laſt prevail to drive him who ſat and ruled as God, in God's Heavenly Temple, the Churches profeſſing God's Name, into the Mahometan and Heathen World, in this Generation now ſhortly coming, as we hope, will partly fulfil that Prophecy, and alſo in His appointed time ſubdue the whole World unto the Scepter of his Son, the Grace and Peaceable Government of truly moſt Chriſtian Princes and Defenders of the Faith of God's Elect.</p>
            <p>§. 95. 3. That which ſeems moſt ſurprizing, that in this Stone, and in <hi>Ariſe Evans</hi>'s Prophecy 1650, inſerted above, <hi>O. Cromwel</hi> is allowed as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Agent, and armed, by comparing the Stone and Viſion together, receives and gives much illuſtration to the predicted ſucceſſes of our Northern Monarchy; which as in his Generalſhip, it gave a great blow to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo may in ſome his more juſt Succeſſors to the command of the Britiſh Arms, paſs on through <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p> §. 96. 4. From what hath been ſaid and obſerved of this little Stone, thus curiouſly wrought and painted without Hands, wherein God by his own Finger, or that of his Hand-maid Nature, hath ſhew'd his Power and Wiſdom, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unimitable, but as to the manner of his Working, unconceivable, there being nothing that I can call to mind to which it is ſecond, or to which it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, ſave the wonderful impreſſions of Fancy and Memory, wrought by the Animal Spirits upon the ſoft ſubſtance of the Brain; that and this compared, altogether incomprehenſible in their Combinations, Diſpoſitions, diſtinct Order, Production, and regular Eduction, will (I aſſure my ſelf) to the Ingenious Readers, excuſe my boldneſs in propoſing it to them as an Emblem of the World and its Contents, and the oppoſite Parties divided and ſtrugling in its Bowels (as <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in their Mother's Womb, emblems of theſe) for the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, the Supreme Dominion in matters Spiritual and Civil, annext to the double portion of the Firſt-born in Chriſt's Family, that is, his Church <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above, the Mother of us all, and her Nurſing Fathers.</p>
            <p>§. 97. 5. Laſtly, If in a Tranſient Viſion, or Dream in ſome Prophet's Head, or in ſome prodigious Appearance in the Air, there had been expoſed to publick view, on one ſide the Pope, and with him the Emperour <hi>French</hi> King, and all the reſt of the Mahometan, Heatheniſh, and other oppoſite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, known Enemies to the Proteſtant Reformation, and Perſecutors thereof; and on the contrary part, in Heaven a glorious Angel, as here in our Stone, and none with him but the preſent King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and ſome one moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Britiſh Captain-General compleatly Armed, the Chief, or only Protectors of that Reformation, None could have refuſed me liberty to have interpreted and applied ſuch a Viſion, or Prodigy, as I have done thoſe in this Stone no leſs Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable; I think then I may with more rather than leſs Reaſon, expect fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Conſtruction, and interpretation of my Application of thoſe Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances not tranſient, but permanent, and to be ſeen of all at ſuch a time as this: the vileneſs and ſmalneſs of the Stone not tending to the diminiſhing, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing our attention and his Honour, who chuſes ſuch ſmall and contemptible things, to teach, yea, to confound the Greateſt and moſt Glorious, and ſends the Fooliſh to learn Knowledg from Brutes, Inſects, and Inanimate Creatures.

            <p>§. 101. THe Heart Prophecy, quoted in the Title Page, written in <hi>Hebrew</hi> on Parchment, and wrapped up in Lead in the form of a Heart, was found under the Foundation of St. <hi>Denis</hi> Church in <hi>France,</hi> by the Sexton of the place, as he digged for the erecting of a Monument for the Lord <hi>Teligni, Anno. Chr.</hi> 1616. He gave it to the Pope's Nuncio, who rewarded him with 200 Dollars. It was tranſlated into <hi>Latine</hi> by <hi>John Barmarino,</hi> Secretary to the Cardinal of <hi>Bruges,</hi> who had it from the Nuncio, and preſented it to the young King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
            <p>§. 105. FOr a cloſe, we will here add ſome other Prophecies, which predict the Fall of <hi>Rome</hi> (though they ſpecify not the Hand that muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it) to be from the North.</p>
            <p>And firſt, let the Nun <hi>Hildegard</hi> ſpeak:</p>
            <p>Popes, Cardinals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaith ſhe, ſeek to defend what they poſſeſs unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: Firſt, with their Curſe, and ſhutting up the Heavens: but the ſame will not ſerve, nor ſhall Men fear it any whit. [Thus much of her Prophecy is fulfill'd at this Day.] After that (ſhe proceeds) they will get them to their Armour and Weapons, but againſt the Judgment of God they can do nothing, for the time is come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſee this fulfilled alſo in our Days, for God hath both diſcovered their Policies, and broken all the Powers they have hitherto brought againſt us.</p>
            <p>§. 106. <hi>Walter Linn,</hi> in the tickliſh Times of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th</hi>'s Reign, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſupport of good Mens Hearts, firſt tranſlated out of the <hi>German</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:99590:31"/>Tongue, and publiſhed certain Prophetical Emblems, declaring the beginning and ruine of the Popiſh Kingdom; theſe were Reprinted by <hi>John Charlewood,</hi> in the Year 1588, (of a good intent doubtleſs) to encourage and animate his Countrymen againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Invaſion; they were of at leaſt 300 Years ſtanding at that time, and taken at firſt out of ſome ancient Libraries, as he relates.</p>
            <p>The very firſt ſymbolizes with this of <hi>Hildigardis,</hi> and ſhall therefore here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt Figure in that Book, is a Pope with his Tripple Crown and Croſier feeding a devouring Bear with Money, without any regard at all to the Holy Dove, which ſat on his left ſide. This the <hi>German</hi> Author expounds thus, by way of Queſtion and Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Wherewith doth the Pope defend his Church now?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> With worldly Might, and cruel Mercinary People, ſignified by the Bear, and not by the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>§. 107. III. The third Figure repreſents a Pope on his Knees, admoniſhed by a Hand out of a buſhy Tree, pulled back by a Fox, that lays hold on, and tugs him by his Monks Hood that hangs down his Back.</p>
            <p>The Monks and Jeſuits are, as it were; the tail of the <hi>Roman</hi> Beaſt, or Papacy, and are the means by which the Pope and <hi>Roman</hi> Church are pull'd and held back (as it were) from hearing the good Counſels ſent them from Heaven for their Reformation, attending to his Admonitions, or regarding the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Hand and Arm bared againſt them, who thereby render all their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions fruitleſs and ineffectual, whilſt Policy over-rules Piety.</p>
            <p>§. 108. V. In the fifth Figure, the Pope with his Sword thruſts the Holy Lamb through the Heart. For which the Devil gives him Keys, <hi>i.</hi> His Papal Power and Might, the Keys of Hell.</p>
            <p>§. 109. VI. The ſixth repreſents the Pope in his Robes, with his Croſier and Keys, and with a Treaſure of Duckets, a Serpent and a Cock on his right Hand, and a Lamb with his Head cut off laid at his feet.</p>
            <p>This the <hi>German</hi> Author thus interpreteth the Pope, partly by the ſenſe (aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſpect) of his Croſs and Keys; and partly by the power of the Devil, and help of <hi>France,</hi> utterly ſubdues the innocent Lambs of Chriſt's Flock.</p>
            <p>§. 110. XII. XIII. XIV. A Bear, with Whelps ſucking on her, fall on the Pope. A Fox runs away with his Banner and Keys. And at laſt he is ſet naked on the Ground, and derided by a Clown.</p>
            <p n="10">X. The Unicorn puſhing down the Pope's Triple Crown, is above. See Chap. II.</p>

            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:99590:32"/>
            <p> I will here, ſaith he, by the way, in favour of my Reader, tranſcribe a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy from a very ancient Manuſcript, found in the Houſe of the Proveſt of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lez,</hi> lately ſent unto me. To which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man may give what Credit he pleaſes; certainly it is not much diſcrepant from this preſent Oracle, as to what concerns the deſtruction of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It runs thus:</p>
            <p>A King ſhall ariſe out of the Nation of the moſt illuſtrious Son <hi>(Lilly)</hi> having a long Fore-head, lofty Eye-brows, long
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99590:32"/>Eyes, an Hawk Noſe: He ſhall draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a great Army, and ſhall deſtroy all the Tyrants of his Kingdom: And ſhall ſlay all thoſe that ſhall fly from his Face; and hide themſelves in Mountains and Caves. For he ſhall be Married unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as the Bridegroom to the Bride. He ſhall continue War againſt them for 40 Years, ſubduing the <hi>Iſlanders, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Italians.</hi> He ſhall deſtroy and burn with Fire <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> and Salt may be ſown upon that Land. He ſhall put to death the higheſt Prelates of the Clergy, who have uſurped <hi>Peter</hi>'s Seat; the ſame Year he ſhall obtain a double Crown. Laſtly, He ſhall croſs the Sea, and enter into <hi>Greece</hi> with a mighty Army, and ſhall be called the King of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> He ſhall ſubdue the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and put out an Edict, that whoſoever will not worſhip him who was Crucified, ſhall die the Death. And none ſhall be able to reſiſt him, becauſe an holy Arm from the Lord ſhall always be with him. And he ſhall poſſeſs the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the whole World. After he hath atchieved theſe things, he ſhall be called the Repoſe of holy Chriſtians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So this Prophecy.</p>
            <p>§. 115. I ſuppoſe the word <hi>Filii,</hi> is miſtaken for <hi>Lilii,</hi> both from the Sence, and from the Context, the Nation of the moſt Illuſtrious Son; unleſs you would underſtand it of the Son of God, and ſo of the <hi>Jews,</hi> I know not how to interpret. That the Author meant ſome King of <hi>France,</hi> or one that is allied to, and bears the <hi>French</hi> Lillies, is manifeſt; becauſe the Kingdoms he devotes to deſtruction, are the known Enemies of <hi>France,</hi> and to whoſe Conqueſt he ſeems moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe and adapted. And by the Iſlands, I underſtand thoſe of the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean,</hi> with which it is moſt probable he may begin to facilitate his Conqueſt of <hi>Italy</hi> after <hi>Spain,</hi> which he hath in his Power already. Here is no mention of the <hi>German</hi> Empire, as if that were already Extinct, or the Princes of it at his Devotion. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſeem to be of his Confederacy, being not named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Conqueſts, and too conſiderable (eſpecially in their Naval Force) and proper to aſſiſt him, to be wholly forgotten, unleſs united with him. Thus far the Analogy holds well with our expected Northern Monarchy, but his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Chriſtian Religion on the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> by the terrours of preſent Death, is not agreeable to that Kingdom of Chriſt, whoſe Scepter is Love, and which muſt certainly ſwallow up all other Powers. Nor muſt I diſſemble, that this Conquerour's War of 40 Years, is not conſiſtent with the ruine of <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> in the Year 1698, unleſs the late and former <hi>German</hi> Wars muſt be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into our <hi>French</hi> Conqueſt, and he only be here deſcribed who muſt put the laſt blow to the Work.</p>
            <p>§. 116. The moſt Critical Trial by which the Spirits of our Modern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Enthuſiaſts are beſt diſcerned, are the limitations of the Times aſſigned by them for fulfilling their Prophecies, in which I find <hi>Cotter</hi> as the reſt ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering and claſhing. For inſtance, in his Viſion of <hi>May</hi> 10. 1621.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:99590:33"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Frederick,</hi> (he means the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> whoſe Head <hi>Frederick</hi> Count <hi>Palatine</hi> ſometime was) ſhall recover by Aid from the North a great Army. From the Eaſt (he means <hi>Turks, Tranſilvanians,</hi> &amp;c.) 6001111 ſhall come, The firſt, ſecond, or third 49, or Jubilee, that is either in the Year 1670, 1719, or 1768, if we muſt accompt from the date of his Viſion.</p>
            <p>§. 117. Fredericus <hi>recuperabit per auxilium a Septentrione Magnum exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citum. Ab Oriente venient.</hi> 6001111. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 49. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 49. <hi>vel</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 49.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe terms is expired, neither of the two latter accord with the Prediction fixed on 1688, nor the Heart Prophecy. Times and Seaſons are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly limited only by the Divine Power to particular Perſons, and their ſmalleſt, as well as to Kingdoms, and their greateſt Actions. It's little better than Atheiſm, to pretend to open that Cabinet by any Picklock of <hi>Geomancy, Aſtrology,</hi> or the like curious and vain Art. I know who ſaid once, that one of ſeven Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities were not true; and a more learned Artiſt than he, much more poſitively affirmed, that one of a hundred horary Queſtions, were not of any certain ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, unleſs ſome unſeen Power brought and wrought the Agents and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, well choſen and fitted, which they call Radical Queſtions. Perhaps ſome will offer me to try before I cenſure, which is to me the ſame kindneſs as to direct me try at the <hi>Delphick</hi> Oracle, whether God will ſuffer the Devil firſt to curſe me, and then to execute his Curſe upon me, by Perſons as Godleſs, as they who believe not his Providence, nor juſt Judgment; who gives them ſtrong Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations, who believe not the Truth, to truſt in Lies.</p>

            <p>And as they hope for a Day, ſo I muſt not deny, but that our moſt favourable Writers do allow them an Hour, and therein a power of Darkning or Eclipſing our Sun, by the interpoſition of their Lunary opacous Body.

An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to an Objection made againſt his Hiſtory, in theſe words: Though the World muſt degenerate more and more in Civility, and Humanity, (as it hath done manifeſtly ever ſince he wrote) and Chriſtianity be eclipſed in an higher meaſure, and the true Worſhippers of God decreaſe above whatever yet hath been done: Though Proteſtantiſm in many Coaſts and Countries, ſhall be totally ſwallowed up of Popery and Mahomitaniſm: More lamentable Wars and fearful Maſſacres rage through <hi>England, Germany, France, Spain, Italy,</hi> and all <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> Monarchies, than we have yet beheld; and though ſome of theſe Kingdoms wholly revolt to Popery, others be Lukewarm, and at a ſtand until 1686, yet all theſe ſhall but make way for the final Eradication of the Enemies of the Church, and the glorious and wonderful Birth and Erection of the Fifth (Fourth) Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy Univerſal, which ſhall be brought forth by theſe Pangs and Sorrows of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>— Now Judgment muſt begin, not at the Temple of Antichriſt, but Houſe of God: And what Blood ſoever is ſhed upon the Soil of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, ſhall be no other than fruitful Showres and warm Seaſons, to make the Field of the Church more pregnant in the production of that glorious Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt

            <p>§. 122. To fill up this vacant Page, it will not be amiſs nor tedious, if I parle a little with my Reader, about our Modern Prophecies at parting.</p>
            <p>Prophecy, in what concerns the Fundamentals in our Religion and ſaving Faith, is certainly at an end. The Spirit of Prophecy foretelling Mercies and Judgments, for Reward and Encouragement of well, and for Puniſhment of or Repreſſing evil doers, is not, as is manifeſt and undeniable, being plain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, in and by many Revelations fulfilled, fore-known, or fore-ſeen and teſtified by many living Witneſſes and Records. Some are here inſerted, many more might be produced. Thoſe of the Reverend Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armath,</hi> of the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> and other particulars long ſince fulfilled, and thoſe yet to come then moſt unlikely when foretold, now ſeem hardly to be avoided, and need not be here repeated, becauſe notoriouſly publiſhed and known to this whole Kingdom. I hope it will be no offence, if I add hither one conſpiring wholly with his, which hath been thus related to me.</p>
            <p>§. 123. A Manuſcript Book was brought a little before the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> 1666, to a Bookſeller, by an unknown Perſon, who deſired to have it Printed and Publiſhed, which declared before-hand what came to paſs as Predicted in that Fire. The Bookſeller refuſed to Print it, becauſe it was not Licenſed; ſo the Author took away his Book with him. In the time of the Fire, this Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99590:34"/>being very buſie, ſaw this Author paſſing by, and told him, That becauſe he had ſo plainly predicted it, he had cauſe to ſuſpect that his hand was in it. Nay, replied the ſtrange Author, if I had been acceſſary to ſo wicked a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I would not have offered my Book to Publication, which I wrote for the diſcovery and prevention thereof. And added, There will follow a more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful execution by Sword than this by Fire, and after that a Famine, if God deal with us as we deſerve.</p>
            <p>§. 123. Ambiguous Predictions, like thoſe of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> and ſome <hi>Delphic</hi> Oracles, without reference to particular Times, Places, Perſons, Groundleſs Figments, Gipſy-like Prognoſticators, Welch Impoſtors, <hi>Teleſen, Panther, Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Prophecy, and many ſuch like which walk about, diſgrace not ſober Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and Premonitions, grounded on ſound Reaſon, and agreeable to Divine Truth.</p>
            <p>I will conclude with <hi>Walter Linn's</hi> Admonition to the Reader, of certain <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emblem Prophecies, Publiſhed by him firſt in <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th</hi>'s tickliſh Reign, and Reprinted ſeaſonably in 1588, for our Proteſtant Countrymens en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, when the invincible Cruſado and Navy invaded us. Whether theſe, ſaith he, or ſuch like Prophecies, be of God or no, let the Godly judge. But ſurely, it is commonly ſeen when God will ſhew his Diſpleaſure and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and intends to bring to paſs ſome great Act, that all Creatures do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie before, and give Warning, although it help but little. Prophets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied the Subverſion of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Chriſt threatned, the Apoſtles warned, all availed not. They heard Voices in the Temple, they ſaw Signs in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they heard Battels in the Clouds. Mad-men, and ſuch as were out of their Wits did propheſie it unto them, but all theſe Signs prevailed not. They were deſtroyed, becauſe they deſpiſed God's Word. Even ſo it ſhall happen to the <hi>Papiſts. Daniel, Zachary, Chriſt, Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. Their own Biſhops, Abbots, Monks, Nuns, Aſtronomers, long ſince prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied it to them; common Rumour, Proverbs, Viſions, Signs, all prevailed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; therefore muſt they be deſtroyed, there is no remedy: That which they will not now, they muſt ſee to their Grief at laſt, when all help is paſt.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let no good Chriſtian grieve himſelf with them, but rather ſuffer and take with Patience, and pray unto God to revenge the Blood of his Saints, and ſpeedily deliver us from thoſe cruel Tyrants. Thereby ſhall a Man get a greater Conqueſt over them, than by Sword and Armour. God knows well where ſuch a <hi>Titus</hi> is, as ſhall be the deſtruction of thoſe Arrogant Rabbies; To whom be all Honour, Praiſe, Glory, <hi>&amp;c. Amen.</hi> So this good Man.</p>

            <p>AFter I had Tranſcribed this, to meet with their Incredulity, which would, as I conjecture, ſeek ſhelter from the unexampled varieties of the Images, ſeen in ſo ſmall a Stone: I met with another Objection, which I thought fit to obviate here alſo, namely, that the Features appropriated in this Relation to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons, as namely to the <hi>Turk,</hi> Pope, Emperour, and King of <hi>England,</hi> are only the Draughts of the beholders Fancies, or impoſed upon them by the Relators. To this I anſwer: That it is as uſual for Perſons, who view the beſt drawn Pieces of the moſt excellent Painters, to differ in their Judgments about them, and ſome to fancy them to be more, and ſome to be leſs, or not at all like the Original. 2. That as in other Pictures, ſo much more in theſe, the curious Artiſt verſt in Minuture, whoſe Eyes ſerve them to work in Draughts to others unperceptible, are the trueſt judges. 3. That ordinary Eyes on firſt view, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being at all impoſed on, have been able to name the Perſons forementioned, without any ſuggeſtion from others; and curious Artiſts, practiſed in Painting, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern many more than others can either ſee or fancy. So that, in truth, they who would reprove others of credulous Fancies, who ſee the aforeſaid Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances in this Stone, do diſcover their own diſtruſtful Fancies, in contradicting their own and others better Eyes in thoſe Objects, of which they are the moſt proper Judges, and whilſt with too much caution they avoid the imputation of Credulity, they lay themſelves too open to the cenſure of the contrary rude and leſs tolerable Vice. 4. Some of the Features aforementioned, are too notorious to be miſtaken by thoſe who know them, and all who ſee them in this Stone, and concur in opinion of their Reſemblance to one and the ſame Perſon (who are not a few) cannot be thought to be led by fancy to ſuch an agreement, and much leſs to combine to deceive others. See the Figures of <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7th. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since this, I underſtand that Mr. <hi>Ellers</hi> is returned into <hi>England,</hi> and is at preſent in <hi>London.</hi> If I can by any diligent inquiry come to ſpeak with him, I will give a more perfect Hiſtory and Deſcription of his wondrous Agat, and preſent the Reader with the Draughts of ſome of the principal Appearances which have been lately diſcovered in <hi>France,</hi> by ſome good Eyes there, beyond what were diſcerned before in this Stone.</p>
            <p>§. 126. <hi>Quirinus Kuhlman,</hi> in his late <hi>London</hi> Epiſtle, hath ſome Paſſages
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99590:35"/>which I thought fit to ſet down here, becauſe of the conſent I find betwixt them and the Obſervations of our learned Aſtronomer Doctor <hi>Banbridg,</hi> §.30. as above.</p>
            <p>In his 41 <hi>Pag.</hi> he mentions the Comet of the 19th of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1652. (fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told 8 days before by <hi>Drabritius</hi>) of the ſelf-ſame day wherein the Orders at <hi>Vienna</hi> were ſigned for a Reformation in <hi>Seleſia,</hi> his Native Country, and which took its courſe from the place of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove with its Olive Branch, directly to that where the famous new Star of 1672 appeared. In the ſame Page is the Solar Eclipſe of the 12th of <hi>Aug.</hi> 1674, interpreted divinely, as he ſaith, by <hi>Stephen Meliſh,</hi> in his 115 Viſion. In his 42 <hi>Page</hi> he mentions two Comets, one of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1664, which joyned it ſelf with another, which appeared about <hi>Eaſter</hi> 1665, near the Ears of the Ram, and became the Sun's Companion, beyond what hath been known in any former Age; and another about <hi>Eaſter,</hi> 1677, which he there terms the ſwift Executor of all the foregoing Stars, Comets, and Conjunctions, and the introducer of Changes upon the whole World. In the ſame <hi>Page,</hi> Paragraph 96, and 97, he thus diſcourſes: Theſe ordinary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Witneſſes, the fore-runners of the greateſt Alterations, though they ſurpaſs the Wits of Heathen Aſtrologers, yet do they ſo clearly atteſt the Change of all Kingdoms, that the publick and private written and Moral Conceits of all Men agree in this; That ſome unheard of Revolution is to be expected. But, ſaith he, there is no Aſtrologer of thoſe I have ſeen, whoſe Conjectures have come nearer the Truth, than the Almanack-Writer of <hi>Staden,</hi> who expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the two Comets of 64, and 65, to two who gave in their evidence before a Judg, and the 3d to a publick Herald, proclaiming the ſentence given in upon the foregoing Evidence: And therefore declares his opinion, That within 24 Months, (<hi>viz.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Id. p. 47. <hi>The two Years time of the laſt Comet expired</hi> May 1679, <hi>ſaith this Epiſtler.</hi>
               </note> before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> 1679.) the Work of God will be Manifeſted, by preparing the whole <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire for quite another War, than is now believed, which is to laſt till the next Age, and to run over the greateſt part of the whole World; and that the end of it will be the Propagation of the Goſpel in the Eaſt, and the return of the Chriſtian Church to the place of its firſt riſe.</p>
            <p>§. 127. This may ſuffice to ſhew the conſent of theſe late Writers, with the learned Doctor <hi>B</hi>'s. opinion, that whilſt Comets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſignifie great Changes for the worſe, to thoſe parts of the World who are Enemies to the Church of Chriſt, they ſignifie the Progreſs and Advantage of the Chriſtian Faith, and its true Profeſſors, whoſe riſe is their fall, <hi>Et vice verſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will add a Paſſage or two out of <hi>Drabritius</hi> and <hi>Cotter,</hi> as I find them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the ſame Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 74. in which he concludes: That whatſoever the holy Scripture hath foretold concerning the <hi>Papal</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> State under the Time, Times, and half a Time of 1176 Years, will according to thoſe Writers be fully accompliſhed in the Year 1688, which harmonizes with that Prophecy of that Year ſet down above, §. 113.</p>
            <p>The words of <hi>Drabritius</hi> in his 395 Revelation, are theſe: <hi>Count the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the</hi> 70 <hi>Weeks from the day of my departure, if thou haſt underſtanding, where an end muſt be made of Battel and Wars, which are at preſent; for when they ſhall cry out Peace and Security, I will come to execute Judgment, the time, and times, and half a time drawing to an end.</hi> So he.</p>
            <p>The Expoſitor puts the time of Chriſt's departure to his 37th Year. The riſe of the Dragon 527, (<hi>viz.</hi> 70 Weeks after) his two times to begin 897, his half 1607, his end 1787, the end of the 1260 Apocalipt Years, <hi>pag.</hi> 74. §. 23. our of the 10th <hi>Chap.</hi> 40th <hi>ver,</hi> of <hi>Cotterus,</hi> he tells us, That the half time of the Treaders down begins 1260, according to which one time begins 612, two times 948, half a time 1620, which accordingly expires 1788. (<hi>viz.</hi> adding 168 to 1620, the Year of our Lord.)</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:99590:35"/>
            <p> According to another Computation out of <hi>Cotterus, Chap.</hi> 24. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. He tells us the 1176 Years of the two Witneſſes, expired 5 Years ſince 1674, their 1260 Year-days, and Solar Months expreſly allotted them in the Revelation, will according to the ſame Explication, end 1685. And that in this regard, the firſt day begins 435, the 2d, 785, the 3d, 1145, the 4th, 1505. So that both according to Solar and Lunar Months, the determined time of the Witneſſes is come.</p>
            <p>He means that according to one Computation, it came in 1674; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the other it is expected 1685, nor preciſely, but within thoſe ten Years, or about thoſe times.</p>
            <p>§. 128. His Obſervation he makes, <hi>pag.</hi> 68, and 69, of the different State of the <hi>Reformed</hi> and <hi>Latheran Charles</hi>'s from the <hi>Papal,</hi> to the joy of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> both <hi>Caroli</hi> and <hi>Carolo,</hi> prompts me to conclude, as he doth, with hearty Wiſhes, That they would unite againſt their common Enemy, before Extremities compel them. That ſo the Prophecy of <hi>Carolus à Carolo</hi> ſet above, may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in them joyntly, or one of them perſonally Leagued with the other.</p>
            <p>§. 129. To fill up this vacant Page, take our <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Muſers interpretation of the time of <hi>Romes</hi> fall, according to his Prediction above §. 111. in his own words, in his <hi>Speculum Speculativum,</hi> pag. 128, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>
